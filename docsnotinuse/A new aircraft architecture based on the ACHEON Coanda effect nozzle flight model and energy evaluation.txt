and they seem very near their limits. This scenario clearly
shows the necessity of radical innovations with particular reference to propulsion systems and to aircraftarchitecture
consequently.

which allows realizing the selective adhesion of two impinging streams to two facing jets to two facing Coanda surfaces.
This propulsion system is known with the acronym ACHEON
(Aerial Coanda High Efficiency Orienting Nozzle). This paper
investigates how the application of an all-electric ACHEONs
propulsion system to a very traditional commuter aircraft can
improve its relevant performances. This paper considers the
constraints imposed by current state-of-the-art electric motors,
drives, storage and conversion systems in terms of both
power/energy density and performance and considers two different aircraft configurations: one using battery only and one
adopting a more sophisticated hybrid cogeneration. The necessity of producing a very solid analysis has forced to limit
the deflection of the jet in a very conservative range (±15°)
with respect to the horizontal. This range can be surely produced also by not optimal configurations and allow minimizing the use of DBD. From the study of general flight dynamics
equations of the aircraft in two-dimensional form it has been
possible to determine with a high level of accuracy the advantages that ACHEON brings in terms of reduced stall speed and
of reduced take-off and landing distances. Additionally, it includes an effective energy analysis focusing on the efficiency
and environmental advantages of the electric ACHEON based
propulsion by assuming the today industrial grade high capacity batteries with a power density of 207 Wh/kg.
Results It has been clearly demonstrated that a short flight
could be possible adopting battery energy storage, and longer
duration could be possible by adopting a more sophisticated
cogeneration system, which is based on cogeneration from a
well-known turboprop, which is mostly used in helicopter
propulsion. This electric generation system can be empowered
by recovering the heat and using it to increase the temperature
of the jet. It is possible to transfer this considerable amount of
heat to the jet by convection and direct fluid mixing. In this
way, it is possible to increase the energy of the jets of an

11 Page 2 of 21

amount that allows more than recover the pressure losses in
the straitening section. In this case, it is then possible to demonstrate an adequate autonomy of flight and operative range of
the aircraft. The proposed architecture, which is within the
limits of the most conservative results obtained, demonstrates
significant additional benefits for aircraft manoeuvrability. In
conclusion, this paper has presented the implantation of
ACHEON on well-known traditional aircraft, verifying the
suitability and effectiveness of the proposed system both in
terms of endurance with a cogeneration architecture and in
terms of manoeuvrability. It has demonstrated the potential
of the system in terms of both takeoff and landing space
requirements.
Conclusions This innovation opens interesting perspectives
for the future implementation of this new vector and thrust
propulsion system, especially in the area of greening the aeronautic sector. It has also demonstrated that ACHEON has the
potential of renovating completely a classic old aircraft configuration such as the one of Cessna 402.

1 Introduction
1.1 Generalities
The future of the aeronautic domain is predicated on the necessity to meet public and legislative demand in terms of increased safety and capacity, reduced emissions and noise,
higher manoeuvrability and increased flexibility of use, reduced time for travel and take off, and reduced landing space
requirements. For example, NASA has launched the
‘Revolutionize Aviation’ program, demonstrating that
‘game-changing’ novel propulsion systems are necessary to
enable the design of revolutionary aircraft that could meet
future and greener needs [1].
The ACHEON (Aerial Coanda High Efficiency Orientingjet Nozzle) [2] is a new propulsive architecture that aims to
fulfil most of these goals. It defines a novel class of aerial
vehicles, which are green, all electric, with improved
manoeuvrability, reduced takeoff, and landing spaces. Cen
et al. [3] have verified that this system has the potential of
increasing the manoeuvrability of a high performance jet with
a significant increase in performance.
This paper considers a more conservative domain. It aims
to verify how ACHEON can be implemented inside the architecture of a traditional twin-engine transport aircraft and analyzes the benefits and the feasibility of the system. A novel
class of transport aircraft, which is designed to benefit of
ACHEON nozzle, is subsequently defined inside this paper.
1.2 ACHEON nozzle architecture
ACHEON nozzle has been defined by Trancossi [4] as a twostream nozzle, which has the ability of deflecting the resulting
synthetic jet by means of the Coanda Effect. This result has
produced a patent by Università di Modena e Reggio Emilia
[5, 6]. The patent has been initially presented by Trancossi and
Dumas [7, 8]. This preliminary investigation has evidenced
the main advantage of the system, which is the extraordinary
reactivity and velocity of response, and the main constraint of
the system that relates to its intrinsic instability. In particular,

Eur. Transp. Res. Rev. (2016) 8: 11

subsequent to investigating the stability problem, the project
has integrated the Coanda effect nozzle with a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) to increase the stability of the system, as
defined by Cattafesta [9] and improved by Xisto [10].
The architecture of the nozzle as originally defined by the
patent is represented in Fig. 1.
The ACHEON nozzle (1) is capable of mixing two primitive fluid jets (2) and (2') and producing a selective and controllable angular deviation of the synthetic jet (7) without any
moving mechanical part. The nozzle (1) is also capable of
changing the direction of this jet in a continuous and dynamic
manner to allow the jet to sweep a preset and arbitrary angle.
The nozzle (1) is constituted, in a first part thereof, by a conduit (8) divided into two channels by a central baffle (9) and,
in a second part thereof, by a convergence zone and an outflow mouth (5) whose walls have a curvilinear profile and are
connected seamlessly to the walls of the conduit. Dragan [11]
has independently validated the preliminary Coanda effect
model by Trancossi and Trancossi and Dumas.
A general overview has been produced by Dumas et al.
[12]
1.3 Coanda effect modelling
Significant research activity has been conducted on Coanda
effect modelling and analysis. In particular, Trancossi, Dumas
et al. [13] produced a theoretical model of Coanda attachment
mechanisms and the laws of the Coanda effect. The proposed
model has been realized by integration of Navier Stokes equations starting from the Dragan [14] model. The authors consider a very conventional setup in order to define by a theoretical analysis a mathematical model of the Coanda adhesion
and define a preliminary model, which could be suitable for
simple engineering calculations and preliminary comprehension of the model by elementary equations. A parametric model has defined as a function of the main cinematic and geometric parameters. The final model relates to three

Fig. 1 Original nozzle architecture (from Patent WO/2013/005132)

fundamental parameters: outlet section, Coanda surfaces radius and inlet velocities. Turbulent and laminar models have
been defined. Validation through a large CDF development
programme has been produced in a regime of stream velocities
from 5 to 40 m/s with good correlation results.
This activity has been improved by Subhash and Dumas
[15], who have produced a large set of numerical computations with different turbulence models on an air jet flowing
tangentially over the curved surface. In particular, they have
obtained that without resolution of the viscous sub-layer, since
it is not possible to determine the computationally independent angle of jet deflection and boundary layer thickness. The
boundary layer analysis has been performed at different radius
of curvatures and at jet Reynolds numbers ranging from approximately about 2400–10,000. The skin-friction coefficient
has been also studied at the separation in relation to the surface
radius and jet Reynolds number. In this research work, the
inter-relation between flow and geometric parameters has
been identified for the further design of the Coanda nozzle
flow.
Dumas, Subhash at al. [16] have analysed the effect of the
temperature of the surface on the Coanda effect adhesion. This
activity has led to the identification of a negative effect of
heated Coanda surfaces on the adhesion phenomena.
Das at al. [17] have carried out numerical simulations to
investigate Coanda flow over a curved surface and analysed
the application to the ACHEON system. He has observed the
effect of Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuators,
concluding that it has an effective capacity both of stabilizing
the behaviour of the system and of increasing the angle of
adhesion. CFD computations were performed under subsonic
condition by Reynolds averaged Navier stokes equations
(RANS).
1.4 Coanda nozzle modelling
After preliminary analysis by Trancossi and Dumas, a more
focused activity has been performed on the nozzle. Trancossi,
Subhash et al. [18] has analysed the ACHEON Coanda effect
based propulsion nozzle for aircraft propulsion considering
the dynamic equilibrium of two jet streams and explain how
the Constructal Optimization process allowed the preliminary
definition of the nozzle. The model has been produced by
assuming an inviscid model. A preliminary mathematical
model of a 2D case of the system has been developed, focusing on the combined effect of the mixing effect of the two
streams and the Coanda Effect Adhesion over a convex surface. Trancossi et al. [19] have specifically modelled the
ACHEON Coanda effect two streams nozzle. The paper tries
to produce an effective design guideline, which can be
adopted for design activities of the nozzle for aeronautic propulsion. The presented model allows the definition of a
governing method for this innovative two-stream synthetic

11 Page 4 of 21

jet nozzle. The uncertainness levels of the model are discussed
and novel aircraft architectures based on it are presented. A
CFD validation programme is presented focusing on validating the model and the designs produced. Pascoa et al. [20]
have produced an effective bibliographic analysis on thrust
deflection systems producing an effective comparison with
other thrust and vector system.
1.5 Dielectric barrier discharge
The Dielectric barrier concept and architecture, which are
used in the ACHEON nozzle, are derived directly from the
one defined by Pascoa et al. [21] in 2009, and is presented in
Fig. 2. Abdollahzadeh and Pascoa [22] introduced a generic
analytical approach that can be used to predict analytically the
momentum transfer in DBDs, allowing a better analytical
analysis of the dynamic behaviour of the ACHEON nozzle.
Abdollahzadeh et al. [23] have explored the use of thermal
DBDs. Until the moment, only non-thermal DBDs have been
used for ACHEON, due to the lower flow speeds involved.
This is a general paper dealing with the numerical modelling
of nanosecond pulse micro-shock wave plasma actuators. As
verified by Subhash et al. thermal effects are negative at low
Reynolds number, but becomes an effective solution at high
Mach numbers, including transonic or supersonic conditions.

2 Definition of the problem
2.1 Generalities
Sunol and Vucinic [24] have started a preliminary analysis of
integration of the ACHEON nozzle into an aerial Vehicle.
Building upon this preliminary result, this paper aims to analyze how the ACHEON nozzle can be further integrated into
aircraft architecture, and in particular will focus on the definition of a specific aircraft model taking maximum advantage of
this nozzle.
Current S-VTOL aircraft are generally not optimized designs because they are based on very traditional aircraft architectures not specifically designed for this kind of operation.
The design optimization will focus on a simplified 2D plane of
motion considering initially only the advantage during take
off, climbing and landing operations.

Four forces act on an aircraft in flight: lift, weight, thrust,
and drag. For an aircraft in cruise, the four forces are balanced,
and the aircraft moves at a constant velocity and altitude. Any
altitude change makes them diverge from equilibrium.
Vertical and horizontal axes of the aircraft have their origin
in the center of gravity. Two flight paths are designed as red
and blue lines inclined to the horizontal at angle c as in Fig. 3.
Take off and landing operation will be evaluated.
The results obtained allow the definition of a configuration
that allows the installation of ACHEON on a very conservative classical airplane design.
This paper will analyze flight mechanics problems starting
from a rigorous Newtonian approach, considering basic equations derived from Newton’s second law. to enable analysis
and understanding of the benefits of the ACHEON nozzle
under different conditions.
Preliminary calculations will be performed assuming the
effects of the pitch as included in the Drag and Lift aerodynamic coefficient.
2.2 Final Remarks about methodology
Because of the methodological analysis performed, some theoretical benefits have clearly been shown. This analysis and
FAR regulations enables the production of an effective mission analysis based on a real plane model.
The characteristics of flight related to the considered potential ACHEON applications inside the project are restricted to
subsonic airplanes. A significant class of vehicles which has
been identified is a twin-engine commuter aircrafts, which are
suitable for Corporate transport and airliner up to 9/12 passengers. Cessna 402 and Piper PA 31 Navajo have been considered also because of their constitutive characteristics and design, even if they are not recent designs.

3 Methodology
3.1 Airplane data
The availability of accessible data makes the Cessna 402
(Fig. 3) the preferred airframe for analysis, also having a wing
structure, which simplifies the adoption of ACHEON ducted
fan system to replace traditional propulsion. The Cessna 402

Eur. Transp. Res. Rev. (2016) 8: 11

Page 5 of 21 11

considering an inlet section 0 and an exit section e, the force is
given by:
:
T ¼ mair;e ⋅V air;e −mair;0 ⋅V air;0

Considering the additional effect due to the pressure difference between inlet and outlet, an additional force term equal to
the exit area Ae times the exit pressure minus the free stream
pressure must be considered. The general thrust equation is
then given by:

Fig. 3 Cessna 402 during takeoff

with ACHEON propulsion is represented in Fig. 4. Each aircraft is designed in order to satisfy the needs of potential users.
Aircraft performance depends mainly on the structural and
aerodynamic characteristics, and the features of the system
propulsion. Assuming Cessna 402 data, which have been obtained from several sources [25–30], it will be possible to
compare a traditional twin-engine aircraft with one propelled
by this new propulsion system. .

It is then clear that the relation between propulsive power
and thrust is
T ¼ ηp ⋅

Thrust is a mechanical force generated by propulsion, as explained by Newton's third law of motion: if a working fluid is
accelerated in rear direction, the aircraft is accelerated in the
opposite direction. From Newton's second law of motion, we
can define a force F to be the change in momentum of an
object with a change in time. The thrust is equal to

Main dimensional parameters, which are calculated according to Trancossi et al. [31, 32], are reported in
Table 2 and considering a different diameter of the
fan. Installing four ducted fan units with a pressure ratio

where kt is the static thrust coefficient and n is the
speed of rotation of the fan.
The advantage supporting the adoption of the Cessna 402
model is the relative high number of aircraft in operation both
produced by Cessna and by Sukhoi. It is an aged project, but
displays good flight performance and behaviour, which is appreciated by pilots, and the very traditional distribution of
weight in the airplane, which fits very well with the use of
such propulsion also because of the construction of wings,
which could allow a good integration of ACHEON derived
propulsion nozzles instead of traditional propulsion.
The ducted fan units have the dimensions specified in
Table 1 and performance specified in Table 2. In particular, a
turbo machine with a pressure jump Δp = 0.3 Patm has been
adopted.
The Cessna 402 has a thrust to weight ratio about 0.37, and
a total thrust of approximately 11000 N. The proposed compressor units, to achieve 30 % pressure jump, require multiple
stages, typical of turbo machinery. The typical compressor
unit has a max thrust about 3000 N, thus there will be 4
compressor units to propel the aircraft with a max thrust about
12000 N.
On this basis, it is possible to evaluate the system. The
deflected thrust by Coanda effect is evaluated according to
Keen [34], who has verified that it is almost negligible because of very reduced frictional effects, and because a very
low lift is produced, in a boxed architecture of the ACHEON
nozzle (Fig. 6). Starting from those preliminary evaluations
the aircraft system will be evaluated.

Calculation of zero angle lift coefficient or zero lift angle
can be done by crudely assuming that the zero lift angle for the
aircraft equals the combination of zero lift angle of the aerofoil
section and wing incidence setting. Calculation of maximum
lift coefficient can be approximately equal to the two dimensional section data minus 5 % due to the negative lift needed at
the tailplane to maintain moment equilibrium. These approximations works properly for the Cessna 402 because of it has
almost rectangular wings.

In case of takeoff and landing, drag can be evaluated by
considering that the landing gears are fully extended, increase
the CD0 and there is a reduction in the induced drag due to the
close proximity of the wings to the ground. The following
expression is used to calculate the increase in CD0:

According to (15) and (15'), the drag is assumed with a

a correction factor for speeds ranging from M = 0.4 up to transonic, but in this case it can be not considered.

3.6 Flight mechanics
3.6.1 Flight analysis in a vertical plane
The lift and drag are aerodynamic forces that are defined relative to the flight path. The lift is perpendicular to the flight
path and the drag is along the flight path. The thrust of the
aircraft is also usually aligned with the flight path. We initially

11 Page 8 of 21

Fig. 7 Forces on an aircraft

assume and investigate the ideal positioning of the ACHEON
nozzle to take the max advantage during take off and landing
operations, assuming that it changes the angle of the thrust
only during take off and landing operations.
Elementary equations of flight become (Fig. 7):

ð21Þ

The resulting equations of motion are:


ðT −DÞ⋅cos γ−L⋅sin γ ¼ m⋅ax
ðT −DÞ⋅sin γ þ L⋅cos γ−W ¼ m⋅ay

ð21’Þ

For small climb angles (<6°), the cos γ is nearly 1 and the
sin(γ) is nearly zero. The system of Eq. (1') then reduces to


ðT −DÞ≅m⋅ax
L⋅cos γ − W ¼ m⋅ay

ð21^Þ

Assuming that thrust can assume different angles than the
trajectory of motion (Fig. 8), the angle of the variable thrust
respect the trajectory is defined with t. The thrust can be
expressed as a function of the angle t + c, which is the sum
Fig. 8 Forces on an aircraft with
variable thrust direction

of the climbing angle with the angle of the thrust with the
trajectory:

T x −D⋅cosγ−L⋅sinγ ¼ m⋅ax

ð22Þ
T y −D⋅sinγ þ L⋅cosγ − W ¼ m⋅ay
where Tx and Ty are expressed as follows:

T x ¼ T ⋅cosðγ þ t Þ
:

ð23Þ

The system of Eq. (23) can be expressed by assuming the
internal trigonometric relations and becomes:

ðT ⋅cost−DÞ⋅cosγ−ðT ⋅sint þ LÞ⋅sinγ ¼ m⋅ax;t
ð24Þ
ðT ⋅cost−DÞ⋅sinγ þ ðT ⋅sint þ LÞ⋅cosγ − W ¼ m⋅ay;t
As before, for small climb angles (<6°), the term cos (c) is
nearly one and the term sin (c) is null. The system of Eq. (24)
then reduces to Eq. (25):

T ⋅cost−D ¼ m⋅ax;t
ð25Þ
T ⋅sint þ L − W ¼ m⋅ay;t
Showing clearly the contribution of the terms due to the
variable direction thrust, which is positive, when thrust is directed upward, and negative, when thrust is directed downward the climbing trajectory.

3.6.3 Stability analysis
Stability analysis will allow the definition of the optimal positioning of the ACHEON propulsion to achieve different
goals and satisfy different mission profiles. Stability analysis
is fundamental for defining optimal aircraft architecture. In
flight, any aircraft will rotate about its center of gravity, a
point, which is the average location of the mass of the aircraft.
We can define a three dimensional coordinate system through
the center of gravity with each axis of this coordinate system
perpendicular to the other two axes (Fig. 9).
Fig. 10 Pitch rotation
equilibrium

The pitch axis is the y axis, perpendicular to the aircraft
centreline and lies in the plane of the wings. Pitch motion is
an up or down rotation around the centre of gravity.
The pitching motion is being caused by the deflection of
the elevator of the aircraft. but also influenced by position
where thrust is applied.
The pitch equilibrium is presented in Fig. 10.
The equilibrium of torques of the aircraft is calculated
around one of the significant points. Usually it is defined as
the center of aerodynamic forces, but in this case due to its
variation as a function of different parameters such as speed it
is preferred to define the centre of mass as being nearly
constant.
It can be demonstrated that the case when the thrust application point is almost coincident with the centre of gravity the
action of the thrust direction change is neutral in terms of
effects on the pitch. It can be also easily demonstrated that,
if it is not coincident, the directional change of the thrust can
be used instead of ailerons for stabilizing the aircraft.
3.6.5 Roll motion
In flight, any aircraft will rotate about its center of gravity. The
roll axis lies along the aircraft centreline. The deflection of the

11 Page 10 of 21

Fig. 11 Roll rotation with
upward directed thrust

ailerons of the aircraft causes the rolling motion. The aileron is
a hinged section at the rear of each wing. The ailerons work in
opposition; when the right aileron goes up, the left aileron
goes down.
Changing the angle of deflection at the rear of an airfoil will
change the amount of lift generated by the foil. With greater
downward deflection, the lift will increase in the upward direction; with greater upward deflection, the lift will decrease
in the upward direction. Since the ailerons work in pairs, the
lift on one wing increases as the lift on the opposite wing
decreases. Because the forces are not equal, there is a net twist,
or torque about the center of gravity and the aircraft rotates
about the roll axis. The pilot can use this ability to bank the
aircraft, which, causes the airplane to turn. it is clear that, if
variable direction propulsion, such as ACHEON, are installed,
benefits could immediately arise on the roll motion control
assuming that the distance of the propeller could be long
enough.
Figures 11 and 12 shows the roll rotation with upward
directed thrust and Fig. 8 with downward directed thrust.
Both configurations can be achieved during different flight
operations.

up and push over. In either case further terms are added to
define the dynamic equilibrium of flight.
For a symmetric pitch up, we conventionally assume that
the vehicle is moving in a large vertical circle, even if the
trajectory can present some differences. When the manoeuvre
starts, the forces, in an airplane with thrust aligned with the xaxis in the vertical direction are:

It is the clear that by deflection of the thrust lower pitch up
radius can be assumed with upward directed thrust and higher
with downward directed thrust.

3.8 Take off and landing operations
3.8.1 Takeoff run dynamics
Figure 13 represents take off operation with a directional
thrust.
A well working set of equation that allows modelling takeoff operations is provided by Phase [25]. It is also necessary to
consider in this part the Federal Aviation Regulations that
defines acceptable procedures for take off operations, FAR
25.103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113 [35–40].. If thrust is horizontal and the weight W = m g the equations of takeoff run are:

ð33Þ

where

and

Equation (43) demonstrates clearly that the take off speed is
lower than the one with t = 0 in the case that t > 0, or thrust is
oriented upward, and higher in the case that thrust is oriented
downward.
Usually the takeoff speed is higher than stall speed at
ground level. It is usually assumed that:

An effective analysis of the detachment phase can be performed after the analysis of the ground-based run after take
off.

3.8.2 Detachment from the ground
After the preliminary ground run the most critical phase of the
plane behaviour is the detachment phase, which is regulated
by FAR standards (Fig. 14). Take off is concluded only when
an airplane has reached an height of 10 m. Assuming the
hypothesis that during this phase the velocity does not change
significantly and remains almost constant .
The radius of curvature can be calculated by Eqs. (33) and
(34). In the case of assuming utakeoff constant, they becomes
respectively:

After this operation, the motion continues with a climb.

3.8.3 Landing operations
Landing operations can be modelled in a similar way and are
almost symmetrical (Fig. 15). In this case FAR 25.119 Landing climb all engines [41], and FAR 25.125 - Landing
[42] applies. Landing operations can be described assuming
an initial push over manoeuvre, which starts at cruise speed

In the case of Eq. (49) with directional thrust, it is evident
that the same radius can be obtained in two modes: a low lift
configuration with higher vertical thrust component, or a
higher lift configuration and lower vertical thrust component,
but also with a downward directed thrust, without changing
the aircraft configuration.
The following manoeuvre is the climb down, with deceleration to a velocity, which is about touch down speed ulanding. It
is in the range
1:2⋅ustall ¼ ulanding ¼ 1:3⋅ustall :
Usually a value of 1.23 ustall is adopted.

In this case, a much lower landing horizontal speed can be
ensured:

It can be then possible to model the final part. If the thrust is
directed in horizontal direction or in a direction, which is
different from the horizontal, it can be obtained:

where μbrake is the friction coefficient during braking phase.
In this case, some thrust directed vertically can be interesting. Braking space can be easily evaluated as in the case of the
takeoff run.

3.9 Aircraft configuration

The final manoeuvre before touching the ground is a further rotation with centre higher than the trajectory starting at

The aircraft configuration has been studied subject to the aircraft performance and required power for different operations.
A complete analysis of the performances of the modified
Cessna 402 plane will be performed against the traditional
plane with propellers [43]. In particular, Fig. 16 shows the
airplane configuration with a section on the ACHEON propeller illustrating the main positioning of the system.
Figure 17 shows the detail of the ACHEON nozzle section
and its configuration so to allow a better comprehension of its
behaviour. In particular, the proposed model presents a limitation in angular terms of the jet, to allow an effective prediction of the maximum angle, which could be reached.

In addition, in this case operations could be performed by different combinations of vertical thrust and
lift force, including fixed aerodynamic configurations
governed simply by jet.

To simplify the model controls and to ensure a better integration with the airplane configuration a positioning of the
geometric centre of thrust coincident with the centre of gravity
will be considered. Otherwise, it is evident that torque components could be introduced with negative consequences on
the aircraft behaviour. The application of the centre of thrust
rotation in the centre of gravity could is also considered to
increase the safety of the system and allowing an adequate
system behaviour in case of technical problems.
In particular, there will be assumed three limiting positions:
–

–

an angle = 0 ensured by top jet (horizontal flight);
an angle = t ensured by both jets (take off);
an angle = 2 t ensured by bottom jet (landing).

Different angles t could apply, as demonstrated by the project activities. they space in a range 12 ÷ 25° . The effects will
be evaluated for some specific angles, while jet velocity and
regimes will be defined according to specific conditions.
Energetic and environmental evaluations will be also
performed.

3.10 Mission profile
To describe the results a specific mission will be considered.
The typical mission profile is defined according to the FAR
standards for commercial vehicles.
In some operations, different operative methods will be
taken into account and will be compared. The analysis will
also consider FAR standards to verify the suitability of the
system for future application into aviation. Further considerations will regard the possible modifications, which could be

necessary to the FAR to allow ACHEON integration.
ACHEON will be also preliminarily evaluated against EC
Reg. No. 216/2008 [25], identifying future certification needs
for flying in Europe. A typical mission profile is illustrated in
Fig. 18.

4 Results
The results will be compared to the effective performance of a
Cessna 402 identifying improved and degraded operation.
Energy and performance related considerations would be performed focusing on the specific effects of the all-electric
ACHEON propulsion system.
Further consideration will regard the necessity of further
improvements, which could be necessary for implementing
in ACHEON. It is assumed to use the same aerodynamic
configuration, which is used for the traditional version and
equal thrust condition.
The main parameters of the aircraft have been preliminarily
calculated [27–30, 44]. The propulsion model is shown in
Fig. 19. The lift and drag data are calculated and reported in
Table 2 and the engine data in Annex, will be used as models
of the aircraft and engine.
A concrete/asphalt runoff is assumed with a friction coefficient 0.02 for takeoff and landing operations.
4.1 Take off evaluation
The following data can be assumed by FAR Part 25 (Table 3).
Simplified takeoff profile is assumed Main data have been
reported in Tables 4 and 5.

Fig. 19 Preferential use of different configurations during different flight
operations

The values in Table 6 have been calculated during
takeoff, considering that the average speeds during these
operations has been evaluated at 0.71 utakeoff [45]. It is
the first part of the takeoff it relates to the following
phases transition a screen up to 35 ft (10 m) has been
considered, as specified by FAR Part 25. Maximum initial vertical speed of 7.6 m/s is assumed for the
CESSNA 402 and it results after take off. It means that
the initial average horizontal speed is 52.7 m.
Energy requirements for take off includes also taxi time,
wait and run, according to FAR Part 25. Ten minutes operation
time has been estimated. .
Advantages in terms of energy saving are evident at each
angle of the takeoff length. It can be verified that if a well
defined load factor has been assumed during operations that
could not exceed 1, adequate comfort of the passengers is
ensured,
n ¼ L=W ;

ð59Þ

which becomes for ACHEON propelled airplanes
n ¼ ðL þ T sin t Þ=W ≤1;

ð60Þ

that constitutes a precise limit to aerodynamic loading in function of the thrust.
L ≤ W −T sin t

It shows clearly that the flight assist can be ensured in two
ways:

ð61Þ

The other evident result is that the same take off performance could be also obtained with a much-reduced aerodynamic lift and then a lower drag.

4.2 Climb
It is assumed that the plane at the end of takeoff segments up
to 10,000 ft (3048 m) reaches the cruise speed (109 m/s).
After the transition phase there is a slow transition from the
dual jet configuration to allow the jet to adhere to the upper
surface, as shown in Fig. 19, but also a climb with inclined
Thrust can be performed. An angle of attach of 7 has been
considered.
The difference in terms of accelerations between the two
solutions is evident by subtracting the system of Eqs. (13) and
(15).

ð62Þ
It is clear the difference of accelerations along x-axis is
reduced, while the one along y-axis is increased.
Average speed during climb can be evaluated in different
configurations:
An average climb rate of 6.7 m/s has been assumed. About
40 kWh (144000 kJ) are necessary in all the configurations.
Expected energy consumption is about 140 kWh (504000 kJ)
for traditionally propelled aircraft and about 53 kWh
(191000 kJ) for electric ones.

Flight will is estimated considering the above model and standard atmospheric data at 1000 m. An average angle of attachment of 3° has been assumed, even if a twin engine aircraft in
cruise could also fly with horizontal axis. Consumption for 1 h
flight at 1000 m and cruise velocity is expected to be 1060
kWh (3816000 kJ) for traditional propulsion and about 360
kWh (1296000 kJ) for the electrical one only because of increased efficiency of electric propulsion. In the case of horizontal flight electric propelled airplane there is no mass reduction and this aspect must be considered during landing
operations.

4.4 Landing
Landing energy needs can be evaluated according to usual
twin-engine general aviation aircraft. Typical angle and airspeed during landing are presented in Table 6.
Landing modes have been presented in Fig. 20 assuming a
traditional 3° glideslope. Figure 20 shows instead the complete landing manoeuvre considered. It is clear that gliding
takeoff requires low energy consumption. A 3° degree
glideslope for a traditional Cessna 402 will require a landing
space, which can be calculated and against the value of 757 m
(declared by the producer). Calculations give a worst result of
about 763 m, which is acceptable because of the necessary
approximations in calculations.
Data between the descent phase and landing using
ACHEON can be assumed adopting a different profile
(Table 7).
Different profiles of climbing have been considered for
ACHEON propelled aircraft. They can be ensured by hybrid
combination of vertical component of the thrust, when
Table 5 Takeoff comparison

Cessna 402 with ACHEON with
different angles of inclination

Propellers

adhering to the lower surface and aerodynamic lift. In this case
the thrust in vertical direction could be almost equal to the one
during takeoff, while the horizontal one is much reduced.
Angle of attack is considered the same as above.
Considering different stall speeds and maximum deceleration
about 3 m/s both spaces and times for landing operations have
been calculated. Results are presented in Table 8.
It is now evident that ACHEON can also perform better
performances in case of landing.

4.5 Further ACHEON system improvements
The ACHEON propulsion system can be improved by optimizing the inlet by an effective improvement of the inlet section, as verified by Trancossi and Madonia [46]. By optimizing the air intake design it can be possible to increase the
propulsive efficiency especially at high altitude. But this level
of optimization it is not performed at this level because it
requires a more effective design activity.

4.6 Energy analysis
This analysis focuses on the energy analysis of the electrical
ACHEON propelled Cessna 402 against the model on the
market [47, 48]. This analysis produces some interesting
results.
In particular, the energy comparison are presented in
Table 9. An emergency reserve higher than 15 % is assumed
to ensure some minutes flight for the electric ACHEON
Propelled aircraft then the time for flight at cruise condition
could not exceed 20 min for electric ACHEON propelled
plane.
It can be verified that the original configuration is not adequately performing in terms of autonomy and energy storage.
A better energy efficiency and cruise performance of the
ACHEON propelled aircraft can be obtained by decreasing
cruise speed to about 324 km/h (90 m/s). Data in this case
indicates increase to 40 min cruise speed.
Assuming average European electric production efficiency
[49], which has been estimated about 50 % in 2010, the effective energy demand will be about double than declared consumptions, but much lower than the one for the conventional
engine.
4.7 Improving the airplane configuration
Improved performance can be ensured by equipping the plane
by an electric lightweight cogeneration system coupled to heat
recovery system. Assum Rolls Royce-Allison Model 250
C20R turboprop [49] with a max nominal power of about
190 kW and continuous power about 170 kW (602.5 MJ) is
considered [50]. It has a weight of 62 kg dry (0.32 kg/kW).

Considering all the necessary accessories a weight about
1.2 kg/kW can be conservatively assumed, including the
heat recovery system. Assuming the hypothesis of recovering heat from the turboprop and converting it by heating
the fluid flow, preliminarily conceived by Trancossi [31],
patented by Dumas et al. [51] and studied by Trancossi
et al. [32]. Using the same calculation methodology used
by Trancossi et al., thermal emission can be calculated by
considering consumption about 0.48 kg/kWh and a conservative global thermal exchange efficiency about 0.4.
The amount of recovered heat per hour is then 338.65
kWh (1220 MJ).
It means an increase in terms of thrust about 30 % that
means a reduction of required electrical power about 54 kW.
This new condition enables flight with a partial system
redefinition and general improve, with overall energy efficiency about three times the one of the traditional airplane.
In this case, it can be assumed the following configuration
250 kg of fuel, 250 kg cogeneration system and 1050 kg
batteries.
This configuration could allow flight endurance about 6 h
with a sufficient reserve,
This result is also interesting because the heat exchanger
produces some losses but can be also used as a stator for
straightening the jet as demonstrated by Shyam and
Trancossi, which increases the adhesion, but also a positive
thermal difference is a benefit because of an increased adhesion capability as demonstrated by Subhash in his thermal
analysis.
The resulting configuration is summarized in Table 10.
The operational reduction of payload, which has been assumed in previous all electric architecture is maintained.

5 Conclusions
This paper has clearly demonstrated the benefits of the
ACHEON nozzle applied to the propulsion of a commuter
class transport twin-engine aircraft. The choice has been focused on the Cessna 402 aircraft because its geometric conformation, which could easily allow a positioning of the
ACHEON nozzle with centre of thrust almost coincident
with centre of mass. The paper produces the basic control equations of an aircraft with this singularity showing the benefits of variable direction thrust applied in
this position.

For simplicity only three positions have been considered,
because they seems the state that can be easily produced at this
level of research activity. They are full thrust (two fans on)
with an angle t of inclination (with t comprised between 0°
and 15 °. A nozzle with opening equal to t so that two extreme
positions could be stabile:
&
&

0° for horizontal flight, with higher jet near 100 % ant the
other below 50 %.
2 t for takeoff operations to sustain the airplane during
operations with lower jet about 100 % and lower below
50 %.

Kinematic and dynamic main parameters have been estimated during critical operations such as take off and landing
verifying the benefits produced by the ACHEON nozzle in
different flight condition. It appears fundamental, even if not
directly presented in the paper, the importance of DBD to

ensure an effective governable transition between the positions to avoid both too fast modifications of the airplane behaviour with potential stability problems and the actual considered capacity of producing thrust in three well-defined
directions.
In particular, further application could benefit from the preliminary definition of a possible single jet architecture, which
aims to reduce the problems derived from high frontal section
required by the dual jet configuration.
A preliminary airplane configuration equipped by high performance batteries is presented.
Energetic evaluations have been performed demonstrating
clearly the advantages of the proposed all electric system because of much higher energy conversion efficiency and because of the possibility, which has been presented to define a
cogeneration airplane architecture equipped by a Rolls-Royce
Model 250 turboprop based cogeneration unit. The large disposability in terms of heat to be dispersed could ensure the
possibility of producing a more effective propulsion effect by
using them to heat the jets produced by the ducted fans.
The clear advantages of the cogeneration based solution
against the battery only one is evident demonstrating the possibility of an effective applicability of ACHEON all electric
propulsion in the future, with a cogeneration based propulsion
architecture.
In conclusion, this paper demonstrates the benefits of
ACHEON based architecture to civil aircrafts ensuring enhanced performance. Even if it is not still sufficient for future
ACHEON equipped aircrafts it is a preliminary basis for continuing the studies on ACEHON through a novel class of all
electrical high performance aircraft, which could not been
conceived before this revolutionary project.
