Abstract
Aromatic compounds occurring naturally in jet fuels are precursors for the formation of soot in the exhaust gas of jet engines.
Directly emitted in cruising altitude, soot particles lead to the formation of contrails and clouds influencing the radiation balance of the atmosphere. Hence, a detailed knowledge on the effect of aromatics on the sooting behavior is of great importance,
especially for the development of alternative synthetic jet fuels. Investigations on the sooting propensity influenced by the
molecular structure and concentration of diverse aromatic compounds contained in synthetic and fossil aviation fuels as well
as blends of synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) with aromatic compounds (SKA) were carried out experimentally. Using a
predefined SPK fuel, five different blends—each containing a single aromatic compound—were prepared in addition to one
blend with a typical composition consisting of all these aromatic compounds. In subsequent measurements, the concentration of the aromatics was increased from initially 8.0 vol%, to about 16.5, and 25.0 vol%. The aromatics added were toluene,
n­-propylbenzene, indane, 1­methylnaphthalene, and biphenyl. The studied jet fuels include fossil-based Jet A-1 as well as
different synthetic jet fuels (with and without aromatics). Furthermore, the experimental results of the sooting propensity
are compared with the results of the hydrogen deficiency model being a measure for the amount of cyclic and unsaturated
molecular structures occurring in a hydrocarbon fuel. This study shows the hydrogen deficiency as a useful tool to make
predictions about the sooting behavior of different fuels compared to a reference fuel at a specified condition. Additionally,
it is observed from the measured sooting propensities as well as from the model predictions of hydrogen deficiency that the
structure of aromatic compounds presents greater influence on the soot formation than the aromatic concentration.

1 Introduction
The combustion of a fuel in a jet engine of an aircraft in
cruising altitude is connected with the direct emissions of
different pollutants such as carbon dioxide ­(CO2), nitrogen
oxide ­(NOx), sulfur dioxide ­(SO2), and soot particles in the
upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Here, the soot
particles act as nuclei for the condensation of water vapor
leading to contrails and cloud formation, which eventually
influences the radiation balance of the earth’s atmosphere

and contributes to an increase in the radiative forcing.
According to [1–3], the percentage of anthropogenic radiative forcing caused by aviation is estimated between 3.5
and 5.0% with contrail cirrus as major factor. It is already
well-known that aromatic components in fuels promote the
soot formation, but due to safety reasons—aromatics contribute to the swelling of certain elastomers (seals) [4, 5]—a
minimum content of 8.0 vol% aromatics is required for jet
fuels containing synthetic components according to ASTM
standard D7566-19 [6]. Due to this specification aromatics cannot be simply left out from jet fuels to reduce the
soot emissions when synthetic fuels are developed. Hence,
a better understanding of the influence not only of aromatics
themselves but also of structural effects on soot formation is
to be gained and necessary for the development of alternative synthetic jet fuels.
Therefore, investigations on the sooting propensity
depending on the molecular structure and concentration of
different aromatic compounds contained in synthetic and

fossil aviation fuels as well as blends of synthetic paraffinic
kerosene (SPK) with aromatic compounds (SKA) were
determined experimentally. In contrast to the commonly
used threshold sooting index (TSI) [7–9], the sooting propensity was estimated by the definition of a soot threshold
as a function of the fuel–air equivalence ratio (φ). Here,
the soot emissions in terms of particle number concentration were measured continuously in the exhaust gas of a
premixed flat flame varying the φ-value, i.e., increasing the
fuel fraction in the fuel–air mixture.
A useful correlation to compare the sooting propensity
of different known jet fuels arises from the definition of the
‘Hydrogen Deficiency’ (HD). Indeed, the hydrogen deficiency does not provide data to quantify the soot emission,
but is beforehand a measure for the amount of cyclic and
unsaturated molecular structures occurring in a fuel. Though
cyclic and especially aromatic (cyclic and unsaturated) components in a jet fuel account for most of the soot formation in
contrast to bulk n-, and iso-alkanes, the hydrogen deficiency
nevertheless correlates with the sooting propensity of jet
fuels. The HD-number poses an easy way to assess the sooting behavior of a jet fuel knowing its molecular composition [10]. Therefore, the experimental results of the sooting
propensity will be compared with the predictions according
to the hydrogen deficiency correlation.

propensity
2.1 Measured fuels and fuel mixtures

(Jet A-1) and four alternative fuels [11]. These fuels comprise two aromatic containing alternative fuels named
ReadiJet and AtJ-SKA (Alcohol to Jet Synthetic Kerosene with Aromatics) as well as two paraffinic fuels
named AtJ-SPK (Alcohol to Jet Synthetic Paraffinic
Kerosene) and farnesane.
The initial, aromatic free synthetic paraffinic kerosene
(SPK) consists of 11.72 mol% n-dodecane + 30.02 mol%
iso-octane + 58.26 mol% n-propylcyclohexane. This
composition is derived from the GC × GC–MS analysis
of synthetic jet fuels [12]. With the restriction of lacking
an affordable and adequate iso-paraffinic species in the
­C12-range, the mixture is supposed to represents aromatic
free fuels in general, thus called ‘SPK surrogate’.
Using this SPK surrogate, five different blends—each
containing a single aromatic compound (toluene, n-propylbenzene, indane, 1-methylnaphthalene, or biphenyl)—
were prepared as well as one blend with a typical aromatic
composition including all aromatic compounds (24.69 mol%
toluene + 47.78 mol% n­- propylbenzene + 19.55 mol%
indane + 7.24 mol% 1-methylnaphthalene + 0.73 mol%
biphenyl). In subsequent measurements, the concentration
of the aromatics was increased from initially 8.0 vol%, to
about 16.5 vol%, and to 25.0 vol% finally. An exception had
to be made for biphenyl being only soluble in the SPK surrogate up to about 17 mol% (15.6 vol%) [13, 14].
An overview on the structure of the components
(including aromatics) used for the preparation of the
surrogate mixtures as well as short information on the
composition of the studied aviation fuels is given in

Investigation of the sooting propensity of aviation fuel mixtures﻿	

2.2 Experimental setup
In present work, the sooting propensity as a threshold in
equivalence ratio is measured instead of TSI/smoke point
included in the standard ASTM 1766. The reason for this
unusual selection has been to extend the use of existing
burner setup, employed for determining the laminar burning velocities, for sooting propensity measurement using a
prevaporised premixed fueled burner system, used so far for
the measurement of the laminar burning velocity, see, e.g.
[15, 16], providing well known and controllable boundary
conditions with respect to mixture and flame. Whereas for
the measurement of the burning velocity, a conical flame is
used; here, a planar flame is stabilized by a nozzle with an
outlet diameter of 12 mm containing a fine-pored sinter plate
and confined by an air co-flow at preheat temperature. The
scheme in Fig. 1 shows the experimental setup consisting of
four parts: (I) the preparation of the fuel–air mixture, (II) the
burner, (III) the sampling probe, and (IV) the soot particle
detection unit. For the preparation of the fuel–air mixture,
(I) the vaporized fuel is first mixed with preheated nitrogen ­(N2) and conditioned to the set temperature of 473 K
before oxygen ­(O2) is added according to the natural ­N2/
O2-ratio in air. The liquid fuel is carried using a HPLC-pump
(LC-20AD, Shimadzu); the gas flows are controlled with
mass flow controllers (mini Cori-Flow, Bronkhorst). During

Fig. 1  Scheme of the experimental setup for the measurement of the
particle concentration in the exhaust gas of a plane laminar flame;
CPC condensation particle counter, HPLC high performance liquid

the whole measurement, the gas velocity of the unburned
fuel–air mixture is kept constant at 35 cm/s. Part (I) preparation of the fuel–air mixture as well as part (II) the burner
are both basically identical with the burner setup for the
measurement of the burning velocity. For these details, the
reader is referred to our previous publications [15, 16].
To avoid disturbance of the flame, the nozzle is surrounded by a laminar purified air co-flow and shielded by a
cylinder made from quartz glass reducing the perturbation
from the environment. The part (III), the sampling unit, consisting of three concentric pipes, is fixed above the burner
and reaches into the exhaust gas. The outer pipe is also made
from quartz glass and has a cone with a fine orifice at the
tip where the exhaust gas from the flame is expanded into
the inner central pipe. In the middle pipe (made from Pyrex
glass), ­N2 is added with a volume flow of about 1300 ml/min
to delay particle coagulation in the exhaust gas by dilution.
The part (IV) of the setup is the detection unit of soot particles. The sample (= exhaust gas containing soot particles)
is measured by the particle number counter (CPC 3022A,
TSI), operating with a total flowrate of 1500 ml/min. This
leads to a low pressure of about 880 mbar in the sampling
unit compared to an ambient pressure of about 965 mbar.
Particles are detected upon a minimum size of 0.007 µm.
Starting at φ = 1.40, the fuel fraction is increased during the
measurement. As soon as the particle concentration starts to

rise, each set φ-value is kept constant for 15 min. The particle
concentration is measured by the particle counter at a sampling rate of 1 s−1 and recorded with an averaging over 10 s
by the Aerosol Instrument ­Manager® Software (TSI) during
the whole experiment. In the evaluation, the particle counts
from the first 3 min were excluded in order to respect the slight
time delay between the increase in the fuel volume flow and
the adjustment of the φ-value.

2.3 Determination of the sooting propensity
As a measure for the sooting propensity, the φ-value is defined
as soot threshold (φST) obtained from the maximum gradient of the normalized particle concentration by extrapolation
to the baseline. For the determination of φST, the φ-value is
increased during the measurement until an average particle
number density (N) of minimum 1­ 05 particles/cm3 over 15 min
is obtained. In the evaluation, the φ-value at 1­ 04 particles/cm3
(= N0) is determined by an appropriate interpolation. Thereon
the particle number density N0 is used to normalize the measured particle number densities leading to the value 1 for the
φ-value at 1­ 04 particles/cm3 determined by interpolation. As
an example, Fig. 2 shows the comparison of the normalized
particle concentrations for the neat SPK surrogate and the
respective surrogates with n-propylbenzene added.
Taking the first derivative at N/N0 = 1, corresponding to the
maximum gradient, the soot threshold (𝜑ST) can be calculated
by extrapolation to the baseline using the equation:

surrogate. The uncertainty of the calculated soot thresholds
is ± 0.01 determined from repeated measurements of the neat
fuel components.

2.4 Results
The results for the soot threshold (φST), depending either
on the concentration of aromatics or the amount of H­atoms,
of all the studied surrogates and fuels are summarized in
Fig. 3. For a better clarity, error bars are only drawn for a
few data points. In general, the uncertainty of the experiment
amounts to ± 0.01 in the determined soot threshold. Since
with an increasing aromatic content, the amount of H-atoms
in a fuel mixture is reduced and the results are more or less
mirrored. The different spread of the data points between the
dependence on aromatic concentration and hydrogen content
is attributed to the consideration of the SPK surrogate in the
hydrogen content. Whereas the detail on the volumetric concentration of the aromatics is independent of the SPK surrogate, the amount of hydrogen atoms is calculated for each
surrogate mixture consisting of SPK surrogate and aromatics.
Regarding the different concentrations of aromatics in
the surrogates, it is shown that the addition of 8.0 vol%
aromatic to the SPK surrogate has a considerably greater
impact on the sooting propensity than the increase in the aromatic concentration from 8.0 to 16.5 vol% or to 25.0 vol%,
respectively. Similar results regarding the sooting behavior of aromatic mixtures were also found by Crossley et al.
[17]. Comparing the influence of the different aromatics,
it is obvious that the individual molecular structure of the
aromatics is more important for the soot formation than their
concentration. In general, the increase in the sooting propensity follows the order mono-aromatics < cyclo-aromatics < bi-aromatics which was also shown by Ladommatos
et al. [18], who investigated the structural effects of various
hydrocarbons on the sooting propensity.
In this study, the mono-aromatics toluene and n-propylbenzene have nearly identical sooting propensities due
to their similar molecular structure (see Table 1). Even a
difference between these two mono-aromatics is to discern
with a constant slightly higher sooting propensity (or lower
soot threshold (φST)) for n-propylbenzene. Although this difference lies within the experimental uncertainty of ± 0.01,
it is to suppose that this finding is caused by the longer side
chain of n-propylbenzene. Whereas Crossley et al. [17] have
made the same observation; Ladommatos et al. [18] have
reported a sooting propensity for n-propylbenzene even
slightly lower than for toluene. But in total ignoring n-propylbenzene, they show also an increasing sooting propensity with growing side chain as well. Similarly, the sooting

tendencies measured by McEnally and Pfefferle group [19]
reported higher sooting tendency of propylbenzene compared to toluene.
As also already shown by Ladommatos et al. [18], the
sooting propensity of indane, a monocyclo-aromatic with
nine carbon-atoms, is found between that of the mono- and
bi-aromatics. Indeed, indane and propylbenzene have the
same number of carbon atoms, but the entire cyclic structure
of indane leads to a smaller H/C ratio of 1.11 for indane
(compared to 1.3 for n-propylbenzene) and therefore to a
distinct higher sooting propensity.
Regarding mixtures containing the bi-aromatics, 1-methylnaphthalene or biphenyl soot particles are formed at distinctly lower φ-values being expected due to H/C ratios
of < 1 for 1-methylnaphthalene (H/C = 0.91) as well as for
biphenyl (HC = 0.83).
For the aromatic mixture, the sooting propensity is
found closer to n­propylbenzene and toluene than to indane
or the bi-aromatics since the mono-aromatics are the main
components.
The height of the soot threshold for the surrogate with
16.5 vol% aromatic mixture is similar to the studied Jet A-1
having an aromatic content of 15.1 vol%. Due to the higher
amount of aromatics, the alternative ReadiJet fuel shows a
slightly higher sooting propensity than Jet A-1. In contrast,
AtJ-SKA has only mono-aromatics at a lower concentration,
but the value of the sooting threshold is nearly identical to
that of Jet A-1.

To explain this behavior, the complete composition
of the fuel should be considered. As listed in Table 1,
AtJ-SKA consists predominantly of iso-alkanes, having
a branched structure, whereas a conventional jet fuel contains typically a significant amount of straight n-alkanes.
Since it is already known that the sooting propensity raises
with the degree of branching in alkanes [17, 18], the similar soot threshold of AtJ-SKA compared to Jet A-1 may be
attributed to the iso-alkanes. The influence of branching
arises also from the comparison of farnesane and AtJ-SPK.
Although farnesane has a higher molecular weight than the
average in AtJ-SPK its sooting propensity is distinctively
lower due to the highly branched structure with quaternary C-atoms in molecules contained in AtJ-SPK. Moreover, these branched molecules lead to a soot threshold for
AtJ-SPK as high as determined for the surrogates with
8.0 vol% aromatic mixture or 16.5 vol% mono-aromatics. Unfortunately, no sooting propensity data on highly
branched iso-alkanes are available for comparison. Only
information on 2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethylnonane (isocetane) showing a sooting tendency more than one order
of magnitude lower than that of 1­methylnaphthalene was
found in the literature [20]. So at present, it is not possible
to explain satisfactorily the sooting tendency of AtJ-SPK
or other highly branched alkanes.

3 The hydrogen deficiency approach
To understand the above measured sooting propensity
from the molecular structure point of view, we considered
employing hydrogen deficiency (HD) as a measure for the
presence of unsaturation and cyclic structure present in a
molecule. This is to the extension of our earlier study [10]
where we showed that the particle emissions measured in
a ground-based V2527-A5 engine of an Airbus A320 can
be extrapolated to other fuels using their HD and one reference measurement. This assessment was also observed to be
extended to the smoke point and sooting tendency measurements from the literature.

3.1 Definition
A useful correlation to compare the sooting propensity of
any multicomponent fuel arises from the definition of the
‘Hydrogen Deficiency’ (HD) [10]. Indeed, the hydrogen
deficiency does not provide data to quantify the soot emission but is beforehand a measure for the amount of cyclic
and unsaturated molecular structures being present in a fuel.
Since the cyclic and especially aromatic (cyclic and unsaturated) components in a jet fuel account for most of the soot
formation, the hydrogen deficiency therefore correlates with
the sooting propensity of jet fuels. Thus, the HD-number
provides an easy way to assess the sooting behavior of a jet
fuel knowing its molecular composition. The hydrogen deficiency as a measure for the degree of unsaturation (double
bonds) and cyclization (ring structure) of a fuel has long
been known in chemistry [21, 22] and is defined as:
(y)
.
HD = (x + 1) −
(2)
2
According to the general fuel formula C
­ xHy, x and y are
the number of C- and H-atoms. By this definition, the HD of
n- and iso-alkanes is zero as in both cases neither unsaturation nor cyclic structures are present. To estimate the HD
of a real fuel, the molecular formula in the form of C
­ xH y
needs to be known. The information on the fuel’s C and H
number can be estimated by the combined use of different
analytical and spectroscopic methods such as gas chromatography (GC), mass spectroscopy (MS), 1H-NMR or 13CNMR spectroscopy.

3.2 Calculation of the hydrogen deficiency
For the calculation of the hydrogen deficiency, a theoretical formula for each fuel and fuel mixture has to be determined. In case of the SPK surrogate and aromatic surrogate
mixtures, the formula is known from the initial weight of

13

the pure components. The H/C-ratio of Jet A-1, ReadiJet,
and AtJ-SKA was determined to 1.95, 1.90, and 2.10. Using
these values, the theoretical formula of the real fuels was
calculated assuming an average number of C-atoms of 11
in each of the fuels. Since AtJ-SPK and farnesane contain
neither cyclic nor unsaturated structures, their hydrogen
deficiency is zero, so they are excluded from the comparison with experimentally determined sooting propensities.
Table 2 gives an overview about the calculated hydrogen
deficiencies including the theoretical formula of each tested
fuel and fuel mixture. Regarding the HDs for the SPK surrogate and AtJ-SKA, the reader is reminded that more than
half of the SPK surrogate is n-propylcyclohexane—a cyclic
component. This leads to a higher HD than for the AtJ-SKA
fuel containing aromatics.

3.3 Comparison with the experimental sooting
propensity
The results of the estimated hydrogen deficiency (HD) are
presented in Fig. 4 as correlation with the sooth threshold
(φST) as well as in Fig. 5 together with the results of the
experimentally determined sooting propensity. Since in
Fig. 5, the amount of hydrogen atoms is chosen as abscissa

Investigation of the sooting propensity of aviation fuel mixtures﻿	

Fig. 4  Direct correlation between soot threshold and hydrogen deficiency

and the results of the hydrogen deficiency lead to a linear
correlation: with decreasing hydrogen content the hydrogen deficiency increases. Furthermore, to allow an easier
comparison with the sooting propensity, the ordinate for the
hydrogen deficiency is reversed.
As the threshold for the soot formation is reduced with
a decreasing amount of hydrogen atoms in the fuel, the

results illustrate that the hydrogen deficiency correlates
with the sooting propensity: the higher the hydrogen deficiency, the higher the sooting propensity corresponding to
a lower soot threshold (φST) as shown in Fig. 4. Regarding the consideration of the aromatics, the results lead
to the same finding as already obtained from the experiment: the structure of the aromatics has a greater influence on the soot formation than its concentration with
the order of increasing impact on the sooting propensity
mono-aromatics < cyclo-aromatics < bi-aromatics.
These results show that the hydrogen deficiency is a simple tool to gain information about the sooting propensity of
fuels without doing extensive experiments or calculations.
Furthermore, it was already shown in our recent publication
in Kathrotia and Riedel [10] that though HD is merely the
subset of H-content or H/C ratio of hydrocarbon molecule,
it provides extrapolation of the known soot emissions. Compared to it, H/C ratio of the fuel can be linearly related to the
emission, but this relationship is non-predictive, i.e., cannot
be extended to predict soot emissions directly. This is mainly
because, the bulk of fuel contains n- and iso-alkanes which
has no major impact on soot emissions (compared to cycloalkanes and aromatics) and which makes also the H-content
of the fuels similar for fuels. In contrast, the HD considers

S. Richter et al.

only the small but important aspect of the fuel components,
namely, the cyclo-alkanes and aromatics which vary among
the fuels and makes extrapolation possible. So with the
use of the HD, the sooting propensity of various fuels can
be predicted using information about the sooting propensity of only one reference fuel is available. Using the ratio
­HDfuel/HDreference-fuel, one can extrapolate the values of soot
parameters like particle mass emission index, yield sooting
index, and smoke point, each based on the known value of
a reference fuel. But, whereas the values of different soot
parameters and to some extent even of the same parameter
obtained from different experiments are not comparable, the
HD enables an easy comparison of the sooting behavior of
different fuels.
A deviation between the measured sooting propensities and the correlation to the hydrogen deficiency occurs
only for fuels with a considerable content of branched
iso-alkanes. According to the hydrogen deficiency, AtJSPK and Farnesane (both with HD = 0) as well as AtJSKA (HD = 0.45) should have a sooting propensity being
smaller (respectively, a higher φST) than the SPK surrogate
(HD = 0.58). But actually their sooting behavior is similar compared to fuels containing aromatics between 8 and
16 vol% as visible from Fig. 4 (see Fig. 3 for aromatic concentration). Since it is not fully understood why the sooting propensity of these fuels is higher than expected, more
detailed studies on the sooting propensity of highly branched
alkanes as well as on the kinetics of the formation of the first
aromatic ring are necessary.
In general, hydrogen deficiency provides valuable initial
hint on the sooting tendency of potential fuels compared to a
reference fuel without a need of experimental investigations.
This is important for new fuels which are investigated for
the fuels of future aviation where their potential emission
tendencies can be estimated beforehand, an important aspect
when the focus of the fuel design is the emission reduction.

4 Conclusion
Within this work, the sooting propensity of different surrogates and jet fuels was determined experimentally. The
various surrogate mixtures were prepared to investigate the
influence of aromatic structures and concentration on the
sooting behavior of fuels. This study shows that the structure of the aromatics plays a larger role in soot formation
than their concentration. In detail, the increase in the sooting
propensity follows the order mono-aromatics < cyclo-aromatics < bi-aromatics. These conclusions were also obtained
when the hydrogen deficiency is used as a parameter to correlate the sooting propensity. From these results follow that
for a reduction in the soot emissions, it is more important
to reduce the content of cyclo- and bi-aromatics in jet fuels

13

than to minimize the amount of aromatics, e.g., by adding
alkanes. Alternatively, this can also be achieved by carefully
selecting aromatic fuel components that have less sooting
tendency. This is not only important for the blending of a
conventional jet fuel with simple alternative jet fuels consisting of n- and iso-alkanes but also for the development of
advanced sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) already containing aromatics.
The results for the tested jet fuels indicate that fuels consisting only or predominantly of highly branched iso-alkanes
have an increased sooting propensity as it is the case for
AtJ-SPK and AtJ-SKA. In detail, compared to the SPK surrogate and the surrogate with 8 vol% of aromatic mixture,
respectively, both AtJ fuels exhibit a higher sooting propensity than expected. Up to now, it is not fully understood why
the sooting propensity of these fuels is higher than expected.
Ultimately, more studies on the sooting propensity of highly
branched alkanes are necessary. Hence, the correlation of the
hydrogen deficiency with the sooting propensity failed for
AtJ-SPK and AtJ-SKA since according to the definition isoalkanes as well as n­alkanes do not contribute to the hydrogen deficiency. Despite such special cases—conventional
(Jet A-1) as well as alternative jet fuels (e.g., ReadiJet) consist typically of several kinds of components—the hydrogen
deficiency is a useful tool assessing the sooting propensity
of various fuels using their chemical composition only, thus
eliminating the need to perform time intensive experiments
or model calculations.
