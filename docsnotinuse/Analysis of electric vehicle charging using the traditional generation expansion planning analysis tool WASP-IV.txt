Analysis of electric vehicle charging using the traditional
generation expansion planning analysis tool WASP-IV
Aoife FOLEY (&), Brian Ó GALLACHÓIR

Abstract Electric vehicles (EV) are proposed as a measure
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in transport and support
increased wind power penetration across modern power
systems. Optimal benefits can only be achieved, if EVs are
deployed effectively, so that the exhaust emissions are not
substituted by additional emissions in the electricity sector,
which can be implemented using Smart Grid controls. This
research presents the results of an EV roll-out in the all island
grid (AIG) in Ireland using the long term generation expansion planning model called the Wien Automatic System
Planning IV (WASP-IV) tool to measure carbon dioxide
emissions and changes in total energy. The model incorporates all generators and operational requirements while
meeting environmental emissions, fuel availability and
generator operational and maintenance constraints to optimize economic dispatch and unit commitment power dispatch. In the study three distinct scenarios are investigated
base case, peak and off-peak charging to simulate the impacts of EV’s in the AIG up to 2025.

1 Introduction
Internationally the drive is on to deploy electric vehicles
(EV), especially as the new mode of private vehicular
transport in urban areas. As society is concentrated at urban
and suburban centers with average weekly travel distances
of approximately 50 miles or 80 kilometers and daily
commutes of up to 20 miles or 32 kilometers, this is an
opportunity to apply a technology with certain limitations
and constraints [1, 2]. There are a number of economic and
environmental benefits to introducing EVs, including reduced oil consumption and dependency, new research and
development and associated job opportunities, a reduction
in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, a reduction in localized noise levels and a reduction in localized air pollution
from other pollutants such as particulate matter (PM10).
These pollutants are linked to global warming, localized air
pollution and deterioration in the quality of human health.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) studied the effects
of a strong policy of ‘decarbonisation’ in transport and
estimated that the introduction of new vehicle technologies
and fuels including some modal shifting in passenger and
freight transport has the potential to generate a 40% reduction in carbon (CO2) emissions [3].
Many articles study potential GHG emissions reductions
from EVs. Boschert [4] provides a detailed review of over 40
studies carried out in the USA to examine the effects of EVs
on well-to-wheel emissions [4]. In [5], future trends of both
direct and life cycle energy demand and GHG emissions in
China’s road transport sector are examined, and the effectiveness of possible reduction measures by using alternative
vehicles/fuels is assessed and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles were found effective at reducing GHG emissions. In [6],
two planning issues are simultaneously examined by employing a multi-objective collaborative planning method
(MCPM). It is shown that MCPM can largely improve

investment efficiency and the user equilibrium based traffic
assignment model (UETAM) is seamlessly integrated to
address the maximal traffic flow capturing problem successfully. In [7], a framework for optimal design of battery
charging/swap stations in distribution systems (i.e. IEEE
15-bus and IEEE 43-bus) based on life cycle cost is provided
and the results show that battery swap stations are more
appropriate for public transport in distribution systems. As
detailed by [8], many different methods are being used to
examine EV battery charging.
In this paper a model of the all island grid (AIG) of the
Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland up to 2025 was
built employing the dynamic programming (DP) based capacity generation expansion planning tool called Wien Automatic System Planning IV (WASP-IV) created by the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) [9] to determine the potential contribution that plug-in hybrid electric
vehicle (PHEV) charging can make in reducing CO2 emissions and changes total energy. In a comparable study of the
AIG the impact of PHEV charging is also investigated in
2020, but using an economic dispatch unit commitment
model and one of the key findings demonstrated that indicated that peak charging has more negative power system
impacts than off-peak charging (i.e. the night-time valley)
[10]. In a further follow-up study by [11] of the AIG in 2025
it was shown that gas will be the dominant source of electricity generation to charge EVs and that wind power will
experience a minor reduction in curtailment. This paper is
divided into six sections. Section 1 introduces and Sect. 2
provides an overview of EV policy and original equipment
manufacturers (OEM) targets. Section 3 describes the DP
based capacity generation expansion planning tool, WASPIV. Section 4 sets-out the methodology used, Sect. 5 presents the results and analysis of the baseline, peak and offpeak scenarios and Sect. 6 summaries and concludes.

Table 1 presents some international targets [12, 13].
European policies on EVs are provided by AVERE (2010)
[14].
A number of countries including some EU Member
States, Japan, South Korea, Canada, China, Israel and the
USA have established EV targets, policies and plans. For
example in the EU each Member State is mandated to ensure that 10% of transport energy (excluding aviation and
marine transport) comes from renewable sources by 2020
[15]. The Irish Government intends to achieve this target
with a number of policies including an increase in the use of
3% biofuels in transport by 2010 and ensuring that 10% of
all vehicles in the transport fleet are powered by electricity

by 2020 [16]. In addition to the benefits of EVs already
discussed there is also the potential opportunity to use EVs
to better integrate renewable energy sources (RES). The
development of EVs involves two sectors, the battery
manufacturers and the EV manufacturers.

3 Generation expansion planning model development
in WASP IV
The methodology employed is traditional long term
generation expansion planning (GEP) [19] using WASP-IV
the IAEA’s commonly used for electricity planning in
monopoly electricity markets [20]. In a monopoly market
the primary objective of a utility is to meet electricity demand within a ‘reasonable’ loss of load probability (LOLP)
or energy not served (energy not served (ENS) or expected
unserved energy is the expected amount of energy not
delivered each year because of scarcities in generating
capacities and or shortage in energy supplies) at a minimum cost, whereas in a liberalized electricity market the
aim is to meet demand at a reduced ENS and wholesale
electricity price [21]. However, all things being equal
supply should always meet demand at the least cost. The
generation expansion model for the AIG is built in WASPIV, which uses three main optimization techniques to find
the most optimal portfolio mix for a power system within
user defined constraints. Probabilistic estimation is applied
to determine system production costs, ENS costs and reliability. Linear programming finds the optimal portfolio

123

mix, which satisfies exogenous constraints on environmental emissions, fuel availability and electricity generation by some plants. The alternative expansion plans are
optimized using DP.
WASP-IV is coded in FORTRAN and consists of seven
modular programmes with a windows based graphics user
interface to input and manipulate data, as shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1 FIXSYS input screen in WASP-IV

Analysis of electric vehicle charging

243

The seven modular programmes are:
1)
2)

3)
4)

5)

6)

7)

Load system (LOADSY), which predicts peak loads
and load duration curves (LDC) for the system;
Fixed system (FIXSYSY), which describes the existing plant, all future firm additions and all firm
retirements;
Variable system (VARSYS), which details the candidate plants available to expand the portfolio mix;
Configuration generator (CONGEN), produces all
possible year to year alternative combinations of
expansion configurations;
Merge and simulate (MERSIM), merges the system
and calculates the production costs, ENS and system
reliability denoted by LOLP for each configuration;
Dynamic programming optimization (DYNPRO),
establishes the optimal expansion plan based on the
input data;
Report writer of WASP-IV in a batched environment
(REPROBAT), summarizes the input data, results of
the study and cash flow requirements of the optimal
expansion plan.

WASP-IV can determine the optimal GEP for a power
system over a period of 30 years, within the system planning constraints, based on total minimum discounted system costs [22]. Each potential series of generators added to
the power system, which meets the power system constraints are weighted using a present value cost function.
The cost (objective) function is based on (1).

In WASP-IV the system reliability is configured using
LOLP. The LOLP index is calculated for each period of the
year and each hydro-condition in the same period weighted
by the hydro-condition probabilities and the average annual
LOLP. The generation of each plant during each period is
determined using the optimal dispatch policy in WASP-IV,
which is based on the availability of plants and units,
maintenance of plants and units, spinning reserve (spinning
reserve (SR) is the unused capacity which can be activated
on decision of the system operator and which is provided
by devices which are synchronized to the network and able
to affect the active power) [24] requirements and other
exogenous constraints such as environmental emissions,
fuel usage and or availability of certain plants as described
in (4).

4.1 Test system
The test system modelled is the AIG in 2010, which had
an existing installed ‘dispatchable’ capacity of 9742 MW,
approximately 5842 MW of which was gas fired. There
was an installed wind power capacity of circa 1533 MW.
There is a 275 kV double circuit interconnector and two
standby 110 kV lines between Northern Ireland and the
Republic of Ireland. The AIG is linked to the Great Britain
grid via the Moyle 500 MW high voltage direct current
(HVDC) interconnector and the 500 MW HVDC East West
interconnector. Thus the AIG can be treated as one synchronous system. The baseline model data was collected
from information published by the single wholesale electricity market operator (SEMO), the transmission system
operators (TSO) and the regulators for Northern Ireland
and in the Republic of Ireland and all island market modelling project and the AIG study [25–31]. This is the base
case scenario.

123

244

4.2 Scenario approach
For each year up to 2025 two distinct charging scenarios
are applied to the base case scenario peak charging when
PHEV charge during the pm peak (i.e. starting 5.30 pm) and
off-peak charging (between 10 pm and 6 am) in order to
simulate the effect of PHEV on the power system. The peak
time window is assigned assuming that this is the time when
PHEV owners arrive home from work. This is a practical
assumption because the deployment of smart metering and
Smart Grid has not been as rapid as anticipated [32]. The
off-peak times are chosen as this is the power system nighttime valley with spare capacity. Figure 2 shows the flowchart approach used to examine the impacts of the two
PHEV load profiles on the power system.
The number of PHEVs charging per annum is estimated
using the results of the ‘Car Stock’ model [33]. Figure 3 provides a graph of the growth in PHEVs of the passenger car fleet
in the Republic of Ireland only, from 2010 to 2025 inclusive as
estimated by ‘Car Stock’. For the purpose of this model a 10%
(i.e. 262068) PHEV target is achieved in 2020.
As the alternating current (AC) from the grid is converted to direct current (DC) in the EV battery pack there
will be power losses associated with stationary loads in the

Fig. 2 WASP-IV GEP & CO2 flowchart

charging process e.g. communication controls and the
battery/engine cooling system [34]. It is assumed 88%
conversion efficiency from AC to DC [35]. Thus more
power is actually required to full charge the PHEV. For this
study it is assumed that charging will take place mostly at
the PHEV home at level 1 charging using a 3.3 kW
charger, which includes the conversion efficiency factor
over 8 hours with ‘trickle’ charging of the battery to reach a
full state of charge (SOC). This applies the same
methodology used in the ‘EV Car Stock’ model, where
plug-to-battery energy losses of 88% conversion efficiency
were used [36]. In order to determine the additional energy
used and the amount of CO2 produced by the power system, WASP-IV is ran without the load of the PHEV (i.e.
base case) and with the load of the PHEV for both the peak
and off-peak charging regimes.
In the test system power dispatch is optimized using
hourly electricity demand curves over an entire year (i.e.
8760 hours) for each year up to 2025. The baseline year is
2009. Figure 4 shows the load duration curve for 2009. A
conservative growth of 1.15% per annum in electricity
demand is taken up to 2025. This data was inputted into
WASP-IV using PRELOAD2.
Peak charging is assumed to occur during peak electricity usage, which is typically between 12 pm and 10 pm
each day. Off-peak charging is assumed to occur during the
period of lowest electricity demand, typically between 10
pm and 6 am. As already discussed a trickle charge approach was applied over the 8 hours. In trickle charging the
battery draws load quickly for the first 3 hours typically
and then slowly thereafter, as in a ‘trickle’.
Wind power generation in this study is established in
WASP-IV as a ‘fictitous’ run-of-hydro unit. The installed
wind power capacity for each year was linearly extrapolated starting with 1533 MW of installed wind capacity in 2009 and 6000 MW in 2020. The Republic of
Ireland has a target of generating 40% electricity from
RES, which is expected to come predominantly from wind
power by 2020 [37]. Northern Ireland currently has a re-

newable target of 12% electricity production from indigenous sources by 2012. In 2010 a revised target of 42%
power from RES, mostly from off-shore wind power, by
2020 was under consultation. The Northern Ireland
Assembly subsequently agreed an increased renewable
target of 40% electricity production from indigenous
sources by 2020 [38, 39]. All the dispatchable plants inputted into WASP-IV are listed in Table 3.
The fuel prices used in the study are given in Table 4 are
the average of the prices published in the AIG study [40].
Finally, note that the SR was left at the default value of
10% in WASP-IV for the test system simulations.

5 Results and analysis
Figure 5 shows the graph of total energy with and
without PHEV charging from 2010 to 2025. Both peak and
off-peak charging modes use in effect approximately the
same amount of total energy per annum, as expected. As
can be seen from the graph the total amount of energy
produced increases as would be expected as the number of
PHEVs charging increases. PHEV charging accounts for
approximately 1184 GWh of additional energy in electricity in 2020. 1073 GWh of additional energy in electricity in 2020 or around 93 kilotonne oil equivalent (ktoe)
(A tonne of oil equivalent (toe) is a unit of energy roughly
equivalent to the energy content of one tonne of crude oil.
The definition in energy terms is that 1 toe = 11.63 Mega
Watt hours (MWh) = 1.163 9 10-2 GWh), of which 42%
is renewable, which equates to 97.65 ktoe when the 2.5
weighting is applied in accordance with Directive 2009/28/
EC. Therefore PHEVs could contribute 1.68% to the 10%
renewable energy in transport target in the Republic of
Ireland.
Figure 6 shows the graph of total CO2 emitted without
PHEV charging, with PHEV off-peak and with PHEV peak
charging from 2010 to 2025. As can be seen from the graph
the amount of CO2 produced without PHEV charging is the
lowest, as would be expected. The amount of CO2 emis-

123

246

Fig. 5 Total energy with & without PHEV charging

Fig. 6 Total systems CO2 emissions per scenario

sions also decreases year on year due to the increase in
installed wind. The PHEV peak charging generates more
CO2 emissions than the off-peak charging as less efficient
peaking and mid-merit thermal generators are used.
This model has not taken into account the stochastic
nature of wind power on the system, which may result in
increased CO2 emissions due to cycling and part loading of
thermal generators [41] (cycling is the operation of thermal
generation units at varying load levels, low load levels or in
a start/stop manner and has cost implications for operation
and maintenance of thermal plant). The analysis is also
limited because the impacts of using surplus wind on the
AIG system to charge PHEV was not included.
The difference in CO2 emissions between the baseline
case, without PHEVs charging and with PHEVs charging
for both the peak and off-peak scenarios is 598 kilotonne of
CO2 (ktCO2) and 375 ktCO2, respectively in 2020. If the
Car Stock model CO2 savings in ICE reductions of 504
ktCO2 is included, then the overall net reduction in CO2
emissions is a reduction of 129 ktCO2 for the off-peak
scenario but an increase of 94 ktCO2 for the peak scenario.
Thus WASP-IV indicates that peak charging increases CO2
emissions. Therefore off-peak charging has more overall
transport and power systems benefits in terms of CO2
emissions reductions and contributes 0.95% to the
Republic of Ireland’s 20% reduction in non-emissions
trading scheme emissions by 2020 relative to 2005 [42].

6 Conclusion
This paper has presented the results of an examination of
the impacts of PHEVs charging on the AIG using the
WASP-IV long term GEP model and two charging scenarios. The analysis indicates that off-peak charging during

123

Aoife FOLEY, Brian Ó GALLACHÓIR

the night-time valley is the most efficient with the lowest
increase in CO2 emissions. This is because base load plants
are used. It was found that PHEV charging accounts for
approximately 1184 GWh of additional energy in electricity in 2020. 1073 GWh of additional energy in electricity in 2020 or around 93 ktoe, of which 42% is
renewable, which equates to 97.65 ktoe when the 2.5
weighting is applied in accordance with Directive 2009/28/
EC. The difference in CO2 emissions between the baseline
case, without PHEVs charging and with PHEVs charging
for both the peak and off-peak scenarios is 598 ktCO2 and
375 ktCO2, respectively in 2020. The model revealed that
PHEVs have the potential to contribute 1.68% to the 10%
renewable energy in transport target in the Republic of
Ireland. The model also shows that off-peak PHEV
charging has more overall transport and power systems
benefits in terms of CO2 emissions reductions and contributes 0.95% to the Republic of Ireland’s 20% reduction
in non-emissions trading scheme emissions by 2020 relative to 2005. The next phase of this research is to develop a
wind-follow Smart Grid charging scenario.
