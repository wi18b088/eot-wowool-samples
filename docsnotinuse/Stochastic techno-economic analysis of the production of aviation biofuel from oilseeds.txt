Stochastic techno‑economic analysis
of the production of aviation biofuel
from oilseeds
Ana Paula M. M. Diniz, Richard Sargeant and Graeme J. Millar*

Abstract
Background: The economic viability of hydrodeoxygenation process using Camelina, Carinata and Jatropha feedstocks for aviation biofuel production was evaluated for two product profiles: (i) maximum diesel production and (ii)
maximum jet fuel production (HRJ).
Results: Deterministic analysis of Camelina and Carinata diesel facilities returned positive NPVs and IRRs of 25 and
18%, respectively. Stochastic analysis suggested that the probabilities of positive NPVs were 75, 59 and 15%, respectively, for Camelina, Carinata and Jatropha diesel plants. Jet fuel facilities presented probabilities of loss of 98, 99 and
100% for Camelina, Carinata and Jatropha scenarios, respectively. Sensitivity analysis determined that financial performance was majorly influenced by feedstock and fuel prices. Categories of subsidies to enhance the attractiveness of
the projects were studied.
Conclusions: Camelina, Carinata and Jatropha plants targeting HRJ required incentives of 0.31, 0.39 and 0.61 US$/L
of biofuel produced, respectively, to reduce the probabilities of loss to approximately 30%.

Background
It is widely accepted that human activities are responsible for global warming [1], with the US Environmental
Protection Agency [2] stating that the largest source of
greenhouse gas emissions is attributed to the combustion of fossil fuels. Bittner et al. [3] reported that the
transportation sector is responsible for 32% of the total
carbon dioxide emissions in the world. Consequently, the
replacement of petroleum-derived transportation fuels
by renewable alternatives is a crucial step in mitigating
the greenhouse effect [4].
The aviation industry accounts for a significant fraction
of global transportation needs [4]. Both Rodrigue et al.
[5] and Klein-Marcuschamer et al. [4] noted that in 2010,
air transport was responsible for about 10% of the transportation sector’s energy use. Bittner et al. [3] estimated

that this latter share of energy use would increase to 13%
by 2040. Regarding greenhouse gas emissions, the aeronautic sector is one of the most rapidly growing sectors,
with a growth rate of 87% since the early 1990s [6]. Presently, it is responsible for 2% of the world’s anthropogenic
carbon dioxide emissions [3], and due to the projected
increase in demand it is expected to be the most polluting transportation segment by 2050 [6]. Advances in air
traffic management and technological improvements to
enhance engine efficiency have the potential to reduce
emissions, but these measures are considered to be insufficient to compensate for the increase in passenger numbers [7]. Therefore, emission reductions from the aviation
sector will require adoption of cleaner fuel alternatives.
The most widely used aviation fuels are JET A-1, a kerosene-type fuel used in gas turbine-powered aircrafts,
and AVGAS, a gasoline-type fuel used in small piston
engine-powered aircrafts [6]. Several authors are in
agreement that the replacement of current aviation fuels
cannot be met by alternatives such as battery-powered

engines or compressed natural gas-powered engines [3,
4, 8]. Instead, the development of jet fuels derived from
renewable energy sources which are competitive with
petroleum fuels in terms of efficiency and price may be
the preferred alternative to decrease emissions from
the aviation sector. According to Chu et al. [9], the use
of renewable feedstocks could provide aviation with
10–50% reduction in emissions. Besides these concerns
about the environment, renewable fuels would also
reduce the dependency on fossil fuels, which are limited
in supply and being depleted at a rapid rate [10].
There are several types of feedstocks which are potentially amenable to synthesis of aviation biofuel. However,
feedstocks derived from food crops, such as corn and soybean, are contentious as they may be better used as food
for humans and animals [11]. SkyNRG, established to be
a global market leader for sustainable jet fuel, agrees that
most of the sustainability impacts of biofuels are directly
related to the feedstock [12]. In response to these concerns,
the aviation industry is now committed to use only secondgeneration feedstocks, which: do not compromise food
security; use minimal land area; require relatively low water
and energy resources; minimize impacts on biodiversity;
and also provide socioeconomic value to local communities where biomass is grown. Oilseeds (Jatropha, Camelina,
Carinata, macauba, babassu), waste biomass (used cooking oil), tallow (animal fat) and algae are some examples of
these feedstocks [13]. The precise feedstock choice should
be evaluated case by case, since some of them can only be
grown in specific regions of the world [14].
Biofuels have already been tested and utilized in commercial and military flights across the world. In Australia,
Qantas operated the first commercial flight powered by
sustainable aviation fuel in April 2012 [12]. The Airbus
A330 was partly powered by biofuel derived from used
cooking oil [15]. In accordance with a statement from
SkyNRG, to be certified for commercial use, sustainable
jet fuels have to meet strict specifications established by
the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)
[14]. The certification is to guarantee safety and performance, and the specifications are related to flash point,
freezing point, combustion heat, viscosity, sulphur content and density [14]. In addition to the final products,
the ASTM also certifies the processes used to produce
aviation biofuels [16].
Wang et al. [16] described several process technologies
which can be used to convert biomass-based materials
into alternative jet fuels. These latter technologies were
noted to be dependent upon the type of feedstock, and
some have already reached commercial demonstration
scale, whereas others are still in the research and development stage. Five technologies for production of sustainable aviation fuel are of particular interest: Fisher–Tropsch

(FT); alcohol to jet (ATJ); pyrolysis; direct sugars to
hydrocarbons (DSHC); and from hydroprocessed esters
and fatty acids (HEFA) [14]. Bio-jet fuels produced
from FT, ATJ, DSHC and HEFA processes are presently
approved for blending into current jet fuels at levels up
to 50%. Mawhood et al. [7] further noted that the ASTM
has formed a task force to work towards the certification of two other conversion technologies: hydrotreated
depolymerized cellulosic jet (HDCJ) and aqueous phase
reforming (APR). Nonetheless, the only conversion pathway ready for large-scale deployment are the hydroprocessing technologies using vegetable and waste oils [16].
Uncertainties related to the economic viability of production pathways for aviation biofuels have prevented
investments in this sector. For Wang et al. [16], production cost was considered the key parameter for the commercial viability of a bio-jet fuel. Mawhood et al. [7]
proposed that the potential to scale up renewable jet fuel
volumes was severely restricted by the lack of low cost
and sustainable feedstocks. Stelle et al. [11] considered
that 85% of biofuel production costs were related to the
cost of feedstocks, and production was the second major
component of the total cost of the fuel. Bittner et al. [3]
concluded that there were five major areas of uncertainty
impeding investments in the biofuel industry: crude oil
price; feedstock availability and cost; conversion technology yields and costs; environmental impacts; and government policy. In summary, to be economically viable,
aviation biofuel must be cost competitive with fossil jet
fuel. The global average price paid at the refinery for aviation fuel in August 2017 was $1.52/gal [17]. The predictions of both Stelle et al. [11] and Wang et al. [16] suggest
that traditional jet fuel will become more expensive, as a
consequence of the trends in petroleum prices, while sustainable aviation fuel will become cheaper as the industry
develops.
Even though the biofuel industry is being largely incentivized by the government of several countries, mainly
due to environmental concerns [18], it is mainly owned
and operated by the private sector [3]. It is unlikely that
private investors will provide substantial financing to
support sustainable aviation fuel production projects
without robust cost predictions [19]. According to KleinMarcuschamer et al. [4], at the same time that there are
many technologies being investigated, there are also a
number of controversial and contradictory claims related
to the performance of technologies and feedstocks or the
advantages of some production routes over others.
Crawford et al. [20] affirmed that the combination of
engineering and economics approach is critical for any
technology to transition from research to industry. This
means that a comprehensive techno-economic analysis to
investigate the economic potential of different scenarios

Diniz et al. Biotechnol Biofuels (2018) 11:161

is an essential step for proceeding with the sustainability
programme of the aviation industry. Techno-economic
analyses of different production pathways and feedstocks
for renewable jet fuels using a deterministic approach
have been reported [4, 20–27]. However, there is a gap in
establishing stochastic models capable of evaluating the
extent to which uncertainties can influence the financial
metrics [3, 9, 28–31]. In comparison with deterministic
models, stochastic versions are considered to be more
reliable, as they inherently assess risk. Instead of forecasting only the most likely rate of a variable, the projections
of a stochastic model show a range of possible outcomes
and how likely each outcome uses Monte Carlo simulation [32]. Chu et al. [9], for example, developed a technoeconomic analysis of the production of bio-jet fuel from
waste biomass and oil crops. Although some scenarios have been demonstrated to be economically viable
under a deterministic approach, a stochastic assessment
revealed that the probabilities of them achieving positive net present values ranged from 8 to 29% depending
on the feedstock, indicating risky investments. This kind
of information is far more valuable for decision makers because they contemplate prices volatility instead
of using single point estimates, which makes the results
more realistic. In addition, both Chu et al. and Bann et al.
[9, 28] used Monte Carlo simulations to estimate policy
supports that would enhance the attractiveness of the
projects.
Therefore, the aim of this project was to examine the
economic viability of the production of aviation biofuel, by comparing and contrasting both deterministic
and stochastic approaches. The central hypothesis was
that stochastic models may provide improved economic
analysis which could accelerate the development of the
aviation biofuel sector. The HEFA process, also known
as hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) process, for converting
Camelina, Carinata and Jatropha was considered. The
selection of the process technology was made based on
its certification and development stage [9, 16], and the
selection of the feedstocks was made based on their characteristics and suitability to Australian agriculture conditions [10, 33–36]. Camelina, Carinata and Jatropha are
known to have high oil content, be able to grow on arid
lands and have high tolerance to heat, drought and pests.
The key research questions of the project were: (1) Is
the production of aviation biofuel from the conversion
process and oilseeds being analysed economically viable
from a deterministic perspective? (2) What is the likelihood of these projects being economically viable when
taking into consideration the volatility of the market? (3)
What policies could be put in place to increase the attractiveness of these projects?

Methods
Process description

Process technologies to produce sustainable jet fuels are
dependent upon the type of feedstock [16]. Oil-based
feedstocks are converted into bio-jet fuels through hydroprocessing technologies, which are the only conversion
pathways considered to be ready for large-scale deployment as approved by ASTM. Pearlson et al. [23] reported
that a life cycle greenhouse gas emissions assessment of
the HDO process suggested a 60% reduction relative to
conventional jet fuel technologies. These authors further
added that this process had proved itself to be effective at
producing drop-in quality fuels, which also brings significant strategic and financial benefits, since drop-ins are
synthetic equivalents of petroleum products. The HDO
process may be altered to create two different product
profiles: maximum diesel production (HRD) and maximum jet fuel production (HRJ) [9, 24]. Maximizing the
production of jet fuel demands additional processing
(isomerization). However, some production of diesel is
unavoidable. In the same way, when maximizing the production of diesel, some jet fuel will also be produced. An
overview of the process is presented in Fig. 1.
Raw material is taken from feed storage and sent to a
hydrotreater along with hydrogen gas. The deoxygenated effluent is cooled by steam generation, and, if maximizing the production of renewable jet fuel, sent to an
isomerization unit. The isomerized hydrocarbon product
is then cooled with cooling water before being sent to a
separator where mixed paraffin gases, carbon dioxide and
excess hydrogen are separated from the liquid products.
Liquid products are separated into liquefied petroleum
gas (LPG), naphtha, hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel
and hydroprocessed renewable diesel.
Evaluated scenarios

To assess the economic viability of the production of aviation biofuel, base case scenarios considering bio-jet fuel
produced from Camelina, Carinata and Jatropha through
both product profiles of the HDO process (HRD and
HRJ) were studied. Information about facility designs,
processes, utility requirements, product yields and financial data was extracted from previous literature [9, 21–24,
37, 38].
Financial modelling

For this study, a weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
model was the adopted method for calculating the appropriate discount rate used for determining the present
value of future cash flows. This method estimates risks
and returns for investments using a combination of
firm-level and macroeconomic analysis, in which each

category of capital is proportionally weighted [39, 40]
(see Additional file 1: C for relevant equations).
Baseline cases were created using the assumptions
summarized in Table 1, and the inputs and outputs that
are described in the following sections. Data were taken
from existing literature [9, 22–24, 39, 41] and transferred
to an Australian context by including in calculations: the
national historical inflation rate [42]; the income tax rate
applied to small business entities [43]; and Australian
prices for consumed utilities [44–46] and generated coproducts [17, 47–52].
Net present value (NPV) was calculated for each scenario. Internal rate of return (IRR) and payback time
were also calculated when applicable. Break-even analyses were performed to estimate the minimum selling

prices of the fuel products and the maximum cost of the
feedstocks that set the NPV of the systems to zero. Variations and uncertainties related to the capital investment,
oil content and prices of feedstocks, prices of utilities and
prices of co-products were assessed and incorporated
into stochastic models to predict the impact on the NPV
of the facilities. These models were evaluated using the
Palisade Decision Tools suite software package which
incorporates @Risk and uses Monte Carlo simulations to
account for the variance in the techno-economic parameters. Finally, a policy analysis was conducted to determine the magnitude of incentives that would be required
to reduce the riskiness of the projects to limits that are
considered acceptable by investors. All financial data
are presented in 2017 US$. Prices in Australian dollars

Hydrogen gas consumption and co-product distributions vary depending on the feedstock being used in the
process [24]. However, due to the lack of information
on the HRD product profile with regard to the feedstocks considered in this project, mass-based product yields were generalized taking into account values
reported by Pearlson et al. [23, 24].

product profiles were obtained from the literature [9] and
adjusted to 2017 US$ using the inflation rates in Australia
[42]. More details are presented in Additional file 1: A.
The total equipment installed cost (TEIC) is the cost
of the equipment and installation. The total direct cost
(TDC) is the sum of the TEIC and the costs associated
with site development. The total capital investment (TCI)
is the sum of direct and indirect costs. The working capital (WC) is assumed to be 10% of the TCI. The total project investment (TPI) combined both the TCI and WC.
The TPI for an HRD plant processing oilseeds was estimated to be US$253 MM, while the TPI for an HRJ facility was estimated at US$422 MM.
Operating expenses (OPEX)

The OPEX is the cost to run the plant and is divided
into fixed and variable. Fixed operating expenses are
constant and independent of production levels. Variable operating expenses are not constant and proportional to the level of production [24].
Fixed operating expenses Fixed OPEX includes labour,
overhead, maintenance, insurance, taxes and contingency.
The assumptions used to calculate the facilities’ annual
fixed operating expenses were derived from reported literature [9, 24] and are shown in Table 4.
Pearlson [24] conducted interviews with industry
professionals who suggested that a reduced number of
staff was required for biofuel plants, since the plant is
not as complex as a conventional refinery, and an average annual salary of US$72,000 was assumed. Overhead costs are minor, representing an average value of
0.2% of the TPI. Maintenance includes costs for materials and labour and was considered to be 5.5% of the
TPI. Insurance and taxes accounted for 0.5 and 1% of
the TPI, respectively. A 10% contingency was included
to manage uncertainties. The fixed OPEX for an HRD
plant was estimated to be US$21 MM, whereas the fixed
OPEX for an HRJ plant was approximately US$34 MM.

Page 6 of 15

Variable operating expenses Variable OPEX includes
raw material, thermal energy, electricity, water and hydrogen gas. The unit prices used to calculate the plants’ total
variable OPEX are presented in Table 4. Prices for Camelina, Carinata and Jatropha were based on the studies of
Chu et al. [9] and Wang [22], and adjusted to 2017 US$.
These prices included costs of seeding, fertilizer, herbicides, harvesting, machinery, labour, insurance, land and
transportation. Utilities’ prices were taken from [9, 44–
46] and all prices in Australian dollars were converted to
US dollars.
Gross income

Hydroprocessing plants convert vegetable oils and hydrogen gas into a variety of products. Some of these products
do not have an inherent value, such as produced water
and carbon dioxide. Valuable primary products include
LPG, naphtha, renewable jet fuel and renewable diesel [9,
23, 24]. Besides these fuel products, Camelina and Carinata produce protein meal from the solvent extraction
process, which can be traded in the animal feed market
[9]. Jatropha meal, on the other hand, is toxic and cannot be commercialized [53]. However, biochar and shell
ash, which are also tradable, are produced from Jatropha
processing [22]. Table 7 lists valuable co-products generated by each evaluated feedstock and the respective unit
prices used to calculate the total gross income of each
facility.
It was assumed that fuel products produced from the
HDO process meet the ASTM specifications for blending
with or replacing their petroleum counterparts and so
can be sold at an equivalent price. Fuel prices were taken
from various references [17, 47–49]. The price for Camelina and Carinata meal was based on the price of canola
meal, since they are new to the market [9, 50]. Prices for
biochar were taken from another study [51]. Since shell
ash prices in Australia were not available in the public
domain, diammonium phosphate (DAP) fertilizer prices
were used as a substitute [52]. All prices in Australian
dollars were converted to US dollars (Table 5).

Produced quantities of each fuel product were determined from the mass balance presented in Table 2.
Quantities of Camelina and Carinata meal were dependent upon the product profile. For each 100 MLY of liquid fuel produced, 145,180 tonnes of Camelina meal are
produced, compared to 97,450 tonnes of Carinata meal
[9]. Biochar and shell ash were assumed to be produced
in the same amounts in both product profiles and correspond to 26 and 251 kg/tonne of oil, respectively [22].
Risk analysis

To better reflect the reality of the market and investigate
to what extent the inputs’ uncertainties can influence the
financial outputs of the projects being analysed, variations related to the independent variables described in
Table 6 were identified and modelled using the @Risk
software from Palisade Corporation, which uses Monte
Carlo simulations to vary all the parameters simultaneously and present the aggregate impact on the technoeconomic metrics.
The variations were based on percentages reported in
previous literature and on fluctuations observed in the
last 5 years [9, 22, 44–46, 54]. Variations in the prices of
fuel products (LPG, naphtha, jet fuel and diesel) were
assumed to be proportional to the variations in the price
of crude oil, which is consistent with historical data for
these products [9].
A Pert probability distribution, which uses three points
estimate, was used for all the parameters. A convergence
test was run on the P99 of the NPV, with a tolerance of
± 2% and a confidence of 95%, resulting in 47,000 iterations. This means that simulations should always be run
with 47,000 iterations or more to produce similar results.
By conservative means, simulations using 100,000 iterations were performed.

Results and discussion
Deterministic economic analysis
Plants maximizing the production of hydroprocessed
renewable diesel

The economic viability of the hypothetical facility maximizing the production of renewable diesel was first evaluated using a deterministic approach. The variables were
fixed at the values stated in Table 7. Variable OPEX and
total revenue were calculated based on a plant operating in accordance with the fixed feed rate. The percentage that each co-product represented in the total revenue
was also presented.
The risk-adjusted discount rate to bring the series of
cash flows to an NPV of zero was calculated at 9.71%.
Therefore, IRRs higher than this indicate positive NPVs
and attractive investment opportunities. Camelina and
Carinata facilities returned IRRs of 25 and 18% and NPVs
of 353 and 185 US$MM, respectively. Jatropha facility
had no IRR and NPV of − 387 US$MM. Only the Camelina and Carinata scenarios exceeded the 9.71% IRR, and
thus had positive NPVs. The payback time for the Camelina scenario was 5.5 years, against 8.3 years for the Carinata scenario.
With the highest IRR and NPV, the Camelina plant
offered the shortest payback time, and, consequently the
best business case, despite having the highest operating costs. Camelina has lower oil content than Carinata
and, because of this fact, requires more feedstock to produce the same quantity of extracted oil for conversion to

HRD. However, Camelina generates substantially higher
revenue due to the larger production of protein meal. It
is important to note that the revenues of both Camelina
and Carinata scenarios were strongly dependent on the
sale of meal; which represented 43% of the revenues for
Camelina and 34% of the revenues for Carinata.
The lower revenue from the protein meal for Carinata
justified the lower IRR and NPV compared to Camelina.
The Jatropha facility simultaneously exhibited the lowest
operating costs and the smallest revenue. It can be seen
from Table 7 that Jatropha was the cheapest feedstock
among the three biomass materials which were analysed.
The price of Jatropha seed was approximately 21 and
29% lower than the Camelina and Carinata seed prices,
respectively. However, the price reduction dropped to
16 and 0.05% when the oil prices were compared against
each other. This disparity was due to the differences in
the oil content of each feedstock. When it comes to the
total revenue generated by the sale of the co-products, it
was not sufficient to cover the operating costs. This calculation explained the resultant negative value of NPV
and non-existent IRR. The Jatropha meal is toxic and
cannot be traded [53]. In addition to the fuel products,
Jatropha produced biochar and shell ash, which can be
commercialized, but the quantity produced is not enough
to significantly influence the total revenue value, in contrast to the situation with protein meal generated by both
Camelina and Carinata.
Additional scenarios considering shortages of feedstock were also analysed. A production facility converting Camelina and operating at 50% of its capacity would
reduce the NPV to − 50 US$MM and the IRR to 7%,
thus becoming economically unattractive. On the other

hand, NPV and IRR of the same plant operating at 75%
of its capacity would be US$151 MM and 17%, respectively. For the Carinata scenario, the NPV and IRR would
be − 134 US$MM and 2% for a 50% operating capacity plant, and US$25 MM and 11% for a 75% operating
capacity plant. Therefore, a 25% reduction in production
would not affect the economic viability of the Camelina and Carinata plants. On the contrary, an increase
in the capacity by 25% would return NPVs and IRRs of
US$554 MM and 33% for Camelina, and US$345 MM
and 25% for Carinata.
Research conducted by Chu et al. [9] also culminated
in positive NPVs and attractive IRRs for HRD scenarios
processing Camelina and Carinata. They returned NPVs
of 195 and 121 US$MM, and IRRs of 28 and 23%, respectively. The noted differences between the results of this
project and the ones reported by Chu et al. should be
ascribed to the distinct discounted cash flow models, and
prices of both inputs and outputs, which in the compared
study were based on the Canadian context. An economic
analysis of jet fuel produced from Jatropha, described in
the literature [22], evaluated only the HRJ product profile, and determined only the minimum selling price of
jet fuel. Results for financial parameters were not made
available.
Plants maximizing the production of hydroprocessed
renewable jet fuel

The comparative variables of the hypothetical production facilities maximizing the production of renewable jet
fuel are presented in Table 6. The Camelina, Carinata and
Jatropha scenarios returned NPVs of − 493, − 717 and
− 1.627 US$MM, respectively. IRRs were non-existent

Diniz et al. Biotechnol Biofuels (2018) 11:161

in all the cases. With these latter results, all scenarios for
HRJ were unattractive. The principal disadvantages of the
HRJ projects over the HRD ones are related to three main
aspects: the necessity of additional process unit operations; differences in the product yields; and relative selling prices of jet fuel and diesel.
When maximizing the production of jet fuel, the use of
isomerization unit was necessary [9, 23, 24]. This situation not only made the CAPEX 67% more costly, but also
increased the fixed OPEX, since it was based on the total
project investment. Furthermore, as the name suggested,
HRJ projects increased the production of jet fuel, while
concomitantly decreasing the production of diesel. However, the selling price of jet fuel in Australia was approximately 60% lower than the selling price of diesel. For this
latter reason, the total revenue generated in the HRJ scenarios reduced considerably, representing reductions of
16, 19 and 30% for the Camelina, Carinata and Jatropha
scenarios, respectively.
Total revenues generated by Carinata and Jatropha
facilities were not even sufficient to cover the operating
expenses. For the Camelina facility, it would be necessary
to increase capacity by 169%, so that it could return NPV
equal to zero and IRR of 9.71%.
For the HRJ facilities, the results reported by Chu et al.
[9] presented bigger distortions. Camelina and Carinata
returned NPVs of 35 and − 29 US$MM, respectively. In
this case, it is important to highlight that the selling price
of kerosene in Canada, as stated, was 80% higher than the
selling price of the same product in Australia. Therefore,
as expected, Canadian HRJ scenarios are less pessimistic
than Australian.
Break‑even analysis

Break-even analysis was performed to determine the
minimum selling prices of the fuel products and the
maximum cost of the feedstock that each model could
tolerate to return NPV equal to zero and IRR of 9.71%.
The main assumptions used while calculating the breakeven prices of the fuel products were that protein meals,
biochar and shell ash prices would be constant, and the
prices of each type of fuel (LPG, naphtha, jet fuel and diesel) would change in the same proportion.
Plants maximizing the production of hydroprocessed
renewable diesel The break-even prices for LPG, naphtha, jet fuel and diesel produced from Camelina in an HRD
plant were 0.50, 0.80, 0.32 and 0.79 US$/L, respectively;
which represented a reduction of 19% relative to the current market prices in Australia, presented in Table 8. For
the Carinata facility, the break-even fuel prices were 10%
lower than the market prices: 0.56, 0.89, 0.36 and 0.88
US$/L for LPG, naphtha, jet fuel and diesel, respectively.

Page 9 of 15

On the other hand, for the Jatropha project the break-even
prices were 19% higher than the current prices, reaching
0.74, 1.18, 0.48 and 1.16 US$/L for LPG, naphtha, jet fuel
and diesel, respectively. The average market prices and the
calculated break-even fuel prices for the hypothetical production facilities maximizing the production of renewable diesel are presented for comparison in Table 8.
Regarding the break-even prices for feedstocks, the
financial models estimated that HRD facilities processing Camelina and Carinata could tolerate increases in
feedstock prices by 16 and 10%, respectively. This meant
that, keeping all the other variables at the fixed values,
Camelina and Carinata prices could rise from 923 to
1070 US$/tonne of oil, and from 809 to 886 US$/tonne
of oil, respectively; then the NPV would be zero and the
IRR of 9.71% would be achieved. However, in the case of
a facility processing Jatropha, the feedstock price would
have to be reduced from 770 to 624 US$/tonne of oil to
reach the break-even point.
Plants maximizing the production of hydroprocessed
renewable jet fuel As all the scenarios maximizing the
production of jet fuel returned negative NPVs, the selling
prices of the fuel products would have to increase or the
cost of the feedstock would have to decrease to achieve
the break-even point. The break-even prices calculated for
LPG, naphtha, jet fuel and diesel produced from Camelina were 37% higher than the average market prices: 0.85,
1.36, 0.55 and 1.34 US$/L, respectively. For the Carinata
scenario, the minimum selling prices of the fuel products
to return NPV equal to zero and IRR of 9.71% were 0.92,
1.48, 0.60 and 1.46 US$/L for LPG, naphtha, jet fuel and
diesel, respectively; which represented an increase of 49%
relative to the current market prices. It was the Jatropha
project, however, which required the largest increase.
Fuel products from this feedstock would have to be sold
for a price 106% higher than the actual prices to reach
the break-even point. In this case, break-even prices for
LPG, naphtha, jet fuel and diesel were 1.28, 2.04, 0.82 and
2.02 US$/L, respectively. The average market prices and
the calculated break-even fuel prices for the hypothetical
production facilities maximizing the production of renewable jet fuel are presented for comparison in Table 9.

In regard to the break-even prices for feedstocks, the
financial models demonstrated that HRJ facilities would
require reductions of 21, 33 and 69% in the prices of
Camelina, Carinata and Jatropha, respectively. In other
words, to achieve NPV equal to zero and IRR equal to
9.71%, the price of Camelina would have to decrease
from 923 to 725 US$/tonne of oil, the price of Carinata
would have to decline from 809 to 545 US$/tonne of oil
and the price of Jatropha would have to fall from 770 to
235 US$/tonne of oil, while keeping all the other variables at the fixed values.
Previous articles [9, 22] reported break-even prices
of 0.69, 0.74 and 1.43 US$/L of jet fuel produced from
Camelina, Carinata and Jatropha, respectively. Jatropha
fuel accounts for the biggest variance between previous
and current results. This might be attributed to significant differences in plant assumptions, such as production
capacity.
Stochastic analysis

To examine the riskiness of investments in the aviation
biofuels sector, uncertainties related to key variables were
considered and modelled into @Risk software, using Pert
probability distributions. These variables include: capital
expenses, oil content and prices of feedstocks, prices of
hydrogen gas and utilities and prices of co-products. All
of them were assumed to be independent of each other.
Plants maximizing the production of hydroprocessed
renewable diesel

Monte Carlo probability distributions in the NPV of the
Camelina, Carinata and Jatropha plants maximizing the
production of hydroprocessed renewable diesel are presented in Fig. 2. The solid shaded areas on the graphs
are the probabilities that range from NPV zero to P90.
Therefore, the probabilities of having positive NPVs and,
consequently, IRRs higher than 9.71% are 75.5, 59.8 and
15.8% for Camelina, Carinata and Jatropha, respectively.
As well as in the deterministic analysis, the best scenario
is Camelina’s, which has 90% chance of achieving an NPV
of US$805 MM, a value 218% higher than the TPI. It is

followed by Carinata, the second most attractive business case. Despite the considerable probability of loss
of 40.2%, the P90 for the Carinata plant is US$602 MM,
which is 137% higher than the TPI. In regard to the facility processing Jatropha, although it has been revealed as
non-economically viable under a deterministic approach,
some chance of having a positive NPV has been shown
in the stochastic analysis. However, with 84.2% probability of loss it is highly risky. Its P90 is US$95 MM, which
represents only 16% of the P90 returned by Carinata, and
12% of the P90 returned by Camelina.
A sensitivity analysis performed for the three scenarios
revealed that the contribution of the key variables to the
variance in the NPV was very similar in all the facilities,
as shown in Figures S1 and S2 in Additional file 1: B. The
price of diesel had the greatest effect on the output mean
and was positively correlated with it. It was followed by
the feedstocks’ price and oil content, which occupied the
second and third positions. The prices of feedstocks were
negatively correlated with NPVs, while the correlation of
the oil content was positive. For the Camelina and Carinata scenarios, the price of protein meal was the fourth
most significant parameter, positively related to NPVs,
whereas Jatropha had the same position occupied by the
CAPEX, negatively correlated instead. Capital expenses
were the fifth most influential parameter for Camelina
and Carinata.
In general, other variables (prices of other co-products,
utilities and hydrogen gas) had relatively low influence on
the NPV of the three plants.
Plants maximizing the production of hydroprocessed
renewable jet fuel

None of the facilities maximizing the production of
hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel presented reasonable probabilities of having positive NPVs. On the contrary, extreme probabilities of loss of 98.2% for Camelina,
99.9% for Carinata and 100% for Jatropha were observed,
as presented in Fig. 3. All three scenarios presented negative P90s: −192 US$MM for Camelina, − 405 US$MM
for Carinata and − 1257 US$MM for Jatropha. Therefore,
these projects were not potentially profitable under neither deterministic nor stochastic analyses.
In regard to the sensitivity analysis performed for the
HRJ scenarios (see Additional file 1: B), it was also possible to note similar effects of the key variables on the
NPV of each facility. In these cases, the first three positions were occupied by the oil content and prices of
feedstocks and price of kerosene. The order of significance, however, differed according to the feedstock. For
Camelina, the parameter that greatest impacted the output mean was its price, followed by the oil content of its
seed and the selling price of kerosene. For Carinata, the

Diniz et al. Biotechnol Biofuels (2018) 11:161

oil content of its seed was the most influential parameter,
followed by its price and the selling price of kerosene. For
the Jatropha scenario, the price of kerosene was the most
significant variable, followed by its price and the oil content of its seed. In all the scenarios, prices of feedstocks
were negatively correlated with NPVs, while feedstocks’
oil content and price of kerosene were positively correlated with them. Other variables such as price of other
co-products and CAPEX contributed approximately with
± 10% or less to the variance in NPVs.
Chu et al. [9] reported probabilities of having positive
NPVs of 29 and 18% for Camelina and Carinata plants,
respectively. No article examining the robustness of the
financial performance of plants processing Jatropha was
found in the literature. The differences between the probabilities determined in this paper and in the research being
compared are very closely related to the selling price of jet
fuel. The facilities modelled by Chu et al. were designed to
operate in Canada, where the selling price of kerosene was
US$0.72/L in 2015. This price is 80% higher than the average price of jet fuel in Australia. The fact that this variable
is among those which most contributes to the variance in
the financial outputs, as demonstrated in the sensitivity
analysis, explains the disparity in the results.
Policy analysis

It was difficult to know exactly at what point in the probability distributions investors would be willing to sponsor a project. Bittner et al. [3] believed that firms would
place a bid at 20 or 30% of probability of loss. For policy
analysis purposes, this project assumed the maximum
probability of loss proposed by them, 30%. Considering
this, the Camelina facility maximizing the production of
renewable diesel would be the only scenario within the
acceptable risk limits. All other plants would require economic subsidies from the government to become attractive for investments. To examine the magnitude of these
contributions, this project studied two main categories of
stimulus based on the results of the sensitivity analyses.
Thus, the first study focused on increasing revenue by
raising the prices of output fuels, while the second exercise focused on reducing costs from feedstocks.
In the first scenario, incentives of 0.06 and 0.28 US$/L
of biofuel produced would be necessary to reduce the
probability of loss to approximately 30% for Carinata and
Jatropha facilities maximizing the production of HRD,
respectively. On the other hand, Camelina, Carinata and
Jatropha facilities targeting the production of HRJ would
demand incentives of 0.31, 0.39 and 0.61 US$/L of biofuel
produced to reach the acceptable risk limits.
In the second scenario, Carinata and Jatropha facilities maximizing the production of HRD would require
incentives of 0.02, 0.08 US$/kg of oilseed purchased,

Page 13 of 15

respectively, to decrease the probability of loss to approximately 30%. Camelina, Carinata and Jatropha plants
maximizing the production of HRJ would need incentives of 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20 US$/kg of oilseed purchased,
respectively, to achieve the acceptable risk limits.
The Camelina, Carinata and Jatropha plants operating in accordance with the feed rate of 39 tonnes of
oil per hour would require approximately 111, 89 and
118 tonnes of seed per hour, respectively, taking into
account the differences in their oil content. Based on the
product yields, 903 L of biofuel would be produced, on
average, per tonne of oil processed. Considering the same
processing rate of 39 tonnes of oil per hour, both categories of incentives would represent very similar costs to
the government.

Conclusions
Under a deterministic approach, only the Camelina and
Carinata facilities maximizing the production of renewable diesel are attractive investment opportunities. They
returned, respectively, NPVs of 353 and 185 US$MM,
and IRRs of 25 and 18%. All other scenarios had negative
NPVs and no IRR. It was noted that the economically viable plants are highly dependent on the sale of protein meal
in addition to the fuel products, since it represented 43%
of the total revenue generated by Camelina and 34% of
the revenue for Carinata. Three main aspects are relevant
to explain the disadvantages of HRJ over HRD projects:
necessity of additional processing, differences in product
yields and relative selling prices of jet fuel and diesel. This
combination simultaneously increases costs and decreases
revenue.
Considering the volatility of the market, the probabilities that the NPV would be positive and the IRR would be
higher than 9.71% were 75.5, 59.8 and 15.8% for the Camelina, Carinata and Jatropha plants targeting the production
of HRD, respectively. Extremely high probabilities of loss
for all the facilities maximizing the production of HRJ were
found: 98.2, 99.9 and 100% for the Camelina, Carinata and
Jatropha scenarios, respectively. Assuming that investors
would only be willing to sponsor projects with probabilities of loss of 30% maximum, only the Camelina project
targeting HRD would be an attractive business case. All
other options would require the implementation of subsidy
policies to increase profits, consequently enhancing their
attractiveness.
To conclude, the results indicate that Jatropha is a disadvantageous option for both product profiles that were
assessed, and under both deterministic and stochastic conditions. Camelina, on the other hand, is the best scenario.
A facility processing this feedstock and targeting HRD is
financially viable under deterministic and stochastic conditions. When maximizing the production of jet fuel, the

Diniz et al. Biotechnol Biofuels (2018) 11:161

Camelina project requires incentives to reach the acceptable risk limits, but they are lower compared to the contributions required by the Carinata and Jatropha facilities.
Therefore, Carinata would be the second best option, but it
would require subsidies for the deployment of both product profiles, HRD and HRJ.
Although the developed model was sufficient for conducting scenario analysis, there is potential in future studies to refine the model even more. For example, changes in
price escalation and inflation rates, as well as process input,
outputs and utility costs are obvious choices for sensitivity
analysis. More complicated risk analysis with forecasting
and predictive simulations could also be used with software
programs such as NeuralTools from Palisade Corporation
and Crystal Ball from Oracle. Another improvement to the
model might include greater focus on break-even analysis
that considers future price trend and uncertainties.
