Bio‑aviation fuel via catalytic hydrocracking
of waste cooking oils
R. El‑Araby*, E. Abdelkader, G. El Diwani and S. I. Hawash

Abstract
Background: Biomass fuels (bio-jet fuel) have recently attracted considerable attention as alternatives to conven‑
tional jet fuel. They have become the focus of aircraft manufacturers, engines, oil companies, governments and
researchers alike. This study is concerned with the production of biojet fuel using waste cooking oil (WCO). Batch
reactor is used for running the experimental study. The catalytic cracking products are investigated by GC mass spec‑
tra. Final products from different reaction conditions are subjected to fractional distillation. The (Bio kerosene) fraction
was compared with the conventional jet A-1 and showed that it met the basic jet fuel specifications. Optimum
reaction conditions are obtained at (450 °C), pressure of (120 bars), catalyst dose (2.5% w/v), reaction time (60 min)
and hydrogen pressure 4 atmosphere. The aim of this study is to produce bio aviation fuel according to specifications
and with a low freezing point from waste cooking oil in one step using a laboratory prepared catalyst and with a low
percentage of hydrogen to complete the process of cracking and deoxygenation in one reactor, which is naturally
reflected positively on the price of the final product of bio aviation fuel.
Results: The results indicated that the product obtained from WCO shows promising potential bio aviation fuels,
having a low freezing point (− 55 °C) and that all bio kerosene’s specifications obtained at these conditions follow the
international standard specifications of aviation turbine fuel.
Conclusion: Biojet fuel obtained from WCO has fairly acceptable physico-chemical properties compared to those of
petroleum-based fuel. Adjustment of the hydro catalytic cracking reaction conditions was used to control quantities
and characteristics of produced bio aviation fuel. Taking into consideration the economic evaluation WCO is prefera‑
ble as raw material for bio aviation fuel production due to its low cost and its contribution in environmental pollution
abatement. Blend of 5% bio aviation with jet A-1 (by volume) can be used in the engine without any modifications
and a successful test of blended aviation fuel with 10% bio aviation has been achieved on Jet-Cat 80/120 engine.

Background
Aviation sector is one of the strongest growing transport
sectors. Global airline operations consumed around 1.5
billion barrels of Jet A-1 fuel. Jet fuel consumption of 705
million metric tons (Mt) generates significant greenhouse
gas emissions, accounting for about 2% of global ­CO2
emissions each year (www.clima​tesol​ution​s.org/progr​
ams/aviat​ion-biofu​els-initi​ative​). For Egypt from 1980 to

Center, Cairo, Egypt

2016, the average consumption value during that period
was 19.32 thousand barrels per day, with a minimum of
7.29 thousand barrels per day in year 1980 and a maximum of 38.11 thousand barrels per day in 2010 (https​://

change push researchers and airlines sector to develop
renewable jet fuel alternatives.

researchers alike. IATA identified biofuels as the most
promising strategies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions
from the aviation sector in the foreseeable future (Yang
et al. 2019).
The high dependence of the bio-jet production cost
would be on the following parameters: (1) feedstock’s
composition and cost, (2) process design, (3) product
yield or conversion efficiency, (4) co-product’s valorization; and (5) energy conservation. Hence, decreasing the
production cost of bio-jet fuel depends on significant
hard work in all areas, including enhancements in the
areas of feedstock productivity, the extracted yield of
oil or sugar yield from the crops, process conservation
energy, and balance between jet fuel product and coproducts added value (Wang and Tao 2016).
Derived jet fuels from renewable feedstock can reduce
the dependency of the aviation industry on one single energy source. Also this can decrease the petroleum
prices, and essentially lowering greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions. The use of aviation biofuels could reduce
greenhouse gas emissions in the life cycle of aviation by
a range of 68.1% in 2050 (Staplesa et al. 2018; Blakeley
2012; Tao et al. 2017).
Investigators from different academia and organizations (the oil-refining industry, the aviation industry, government, bio fuel companies, agricultural organizations),
tried to develop new commercially practicable and sustainable processes that produce renewable low cost jet
fuels with low greenhouse gas emissions. Produced jet
fuels must meet (ASTM) international standards and can
be a 100% drop-in replacement for the current petroleum
jet fuel. The emissions after combustion and engine tests
show up the benefits of running the aero plane with biojet fuels. Technologies for producing renewable jet fuels
from different pathways containing alcohols-to-jet, oilto-jet, syngas-to-jet, and sugar-to-jet, are studied. The
main challenges for each technology pathway, including
feedstock availability, process conceptual design and economics, life-cycle assessment of greenhouse gas emissions, and commercial willingness, are discussed (Wang
et al. 2016).
Several types of feed stocks for bio aviation fuel production are listed as (a) oil-based feedstocks, such as
vegetable oils, waste oils, algal oils, and pyrolysis oils; (b)
solid-based feedstocks, such as lignocellulosic biomass
(including wood products, forestry waste, and agricultural residue) and organic portion of municipal waste
or (c) gas-based feedstocks, such as biogas and syngas
(ICCT 2019).
Using Camelina, jatropha and algae, as raw materials
for Jet fuel production reduce the fuel’s carbon foot print
by80% relative to jet fuel without competing for food
sources (Bailis and Bake 2010).

Basically, kerosene is a straight-run distillate of petroleum fraction with boiling temperature ranging from 205
to 260 °C. Increasing jet fuel production decreases obviously the production of other products (Sun 2012).
Also safety and security of supply criteria change and
developed the specifications of aviation kerosene (Pires
et al. 2018; Corporan et al. 2011; Hileman and Stratton
2014). Strategy of both environmentally and economically feasibility of bio fuel production is related to the
development of conversion technologies and feed stock
resources so that the cost-competitive production of bio
fuels is compatible with the use of sustainable low cost,
and diverse feed stocks (Sathaye et al. 2011; Skreiberg
et al. 2013).
Most contaminants that result in bio oil yields can
be traced back to the feedstock, such as residual solids
(char), alkali metals, and high water content (Zacher et al.
2014a).
Common technologies used is catalytic hydride oxygenation at high pressure (Mante et al. 2017) which generates a hydrocarbon liquid suitable for co-processing in
a petroleum refinery or blending into finished fuel (Talmadge et al. 2014). To achieve IATA goals, higher blending rates may eventually be required. In fact, this product
may not be available everywhere during the growing
period. The ability to mix higher ratios in some locations
can help achieve the establishment objectives, taking into
account the local availability of the product (Chuck and
Donnelly 2014). The first task of the High Biofuel Blends
in Aviation (HBBA) study was to establish the relevant
range of properties of conventional kerosene properties,
and to identify sources for the supply of suitable samples
(Prussi et al. 2019). The target set by the European Union
Flightpath for the aviation sector focuses on all methods
of production, but in particular, takes into account artificial paraffin or biologically derived biomass. Aviation
biofuels must be fully compatible and can be combined
with standard fossil fuels (such as Jet-A fuel). These fuels
should also be tested and approved before commercial
use, and emissions are verified. In addition, production
and use should not only be developed and verified, but
also the entire transport and distribution chain (Chairamonti 2019).
Conventional biofuels cannot be mixed even in very
few percentages with fossil kerosene, as the fuel standards are too strict for aircraft engines. This also applies
to distilled fractions of conventional biofuels (Chuck and
Donnelly 2014).
The first track relies on vegetable oils and fats, and
therefore on raw materials such as oilseeds or fat-rich
algae, residues such as cooking oil used or animal fat, or
even common products such as tall oil from the papermaking industry (Chuck and Donnelly 2014; Prussi et al.

El‑Araby et al. Bull Natl Res Cent

(2020) 44:177

2019). Esterification is not a vital option for the production of aviation fuel: the so-called "biodiesel", is a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) to be used as a
low component (5–7%) in the land transport mix. On the
contrary, hydrogen treatment of fats can be applied to the
production of jet fuel, as has already been done by many
companies (such as Neste Oil, Petrobras, ENI/UOP, etc.)
to obtain high-quality biomass-derived fuel, compared
with FAME (Chairamonti 2019).
It is clear that if biodiesel is to be used for aviation then
it will have to contain short-chain esters rather than longchain polyunsaturated. While hydrogen-treated triglycerides are accepted as synthetic aviation fuels, a number
of studies have shown biodiesel, alkyl esters of fatty acids
produced by the glyceride transformation process, to be
a suitable fuel for gas turbine engines. Biodiesel typically
contains straight-chain fatty acid esters ranging from 16
to 18 carbon atoms that can contain 3 double bonds. Biodiesel is suitable for aviation if composed solely of short
chain saturates (Chuck and Donnelly 2014; Wang et al.
2016). However, the melting points of long-chain saturated and unsaturated esters are too high to be suitable
for flight. Reducing the length of the chain or increasing
the level of saturation significantly reduces the freezing point (Wahyudi 2018; Holladay 2015a; Gawron and
Białecki 2018).
Numerous literatures have examined the effect of
hydro treating process on bio-oil characteristics (Zacher
et al. 2014b; Howe et al. 2015). The produced hydrocarbon via zinc aluminate as catalyst was mainly branched
alkanes and cycloalkanes with a maximum yield ≈ 89%
after upgrading and distillation processes (Hawash et al.
2017). Overall, thermo- chemical conversion is an important route for the production of biojet fuel using vegetable oils (Xu et al. 2016).
The present investigation is undertaken to study the
effect of change of operating conditions in the hydro
thermal catalytic cracking process for converting waste
cooking oils to bio aviation fuel through the determination of different parameters representing the experimental results based on the rate of depression in freezing
point of the produced bio kerosene with different reaction conditions and the test proved that the obtained
thrust of using 10% blend of the produced bio aviation
fuel is in a good agreement with jet A-1 specifications.

Raw materials preparation
Preparation of waste cooking oil

The WCO was filtered to remove any solid impurities
prior to the analysis.
Preparation of catalyst (Zn ­Al2O4) nano particles

The used Zinc aluminate as a catalyst was prepared by
co-precipitation method using 48 g ­
H2O, zinc nitrate
Zn(NO3)2·6 ­H2O (96% purity) and 120 g aluminum
nitrate Al(NO3)3·9H2O (98% purity) (Diwani et al.
2009; Battiston et al. 2014), LOBA CHEMI company.
­(ZnAl2O4) nano particles were investigated by using
transmission electron microscope (TEM) which operates on the same basic principles as the light microscope
but uses electrons instead of light, small amount of powder was dispersed in ethanol using an ultrasonic bath for
30 min. Then few drops were placed onto a carbon coated
cupper grid. Specific surface area was calculated by BET
method using ­N2 adsorption experiments.
BET surface area analyzers determine the total surface
area of a solid by suspending a powdered analyte in an
inert gaseous bath and measuring the adsorption of gas
molecules to the surface and its porous structures. This
can be measured volumetrically or via a continuous flow.
Preparation of thermal hydro‑catalytic cracking process

The experimental work was carried on floor-stand reactor under pressure (Parr reactor) with 400 ml. volume.
The reactor includes stainless steel vessel, pressure gauge
and a heating jacket. The temperature inside the reactor
was controlled by proportional integral derivative panel
(PID).
The reactor vessel was charged with oil (100 ml) and
(2.5% w/v) of Z
­ nAl2O4 catalyst. Applied process parameters were varied: the reaction temperature from 400
to 450 °C, starting hydrogen pressure of 4 atm then the
pressure increased with heat and time to reach a range of
(59–130 bass), and the reaction time from 20 to 60 min.
Operating conditions of different experiments are shown
in Table 1 and the process flowchart is illustrated in
Fig. 1. the reaction operating conditions were changed as
follows:
• Time from 20 to 60 min.
• Temperature from 350 to 450 °C.
• Hydrogen pressure of 4 bars.

temperature range from 82 to 350 °C for separation of
products which are subjected to further analysis and
testing, Fig. 2. The fractional distillation was achieved
for the hydrocracking product to obtain the different
distilled fractions: 1—bio gasoline (< 120 °C), 2—bio
kerosene (120–245 °C), 3—biodiesel (245–350 °C), 4—
heavy product (> 350 °C) as shown in Fig. 3.
Preparation of GC/mass analytical procedure

Gas chromatography Mass (GC/MS) was performed for
determination of the product fuel constitution using
Thermo Scientific, ISQ Single Quadruple MS, TG-5 MS
fused silica capillary column (30 m, 0.251 mm, 0.1 mm
film thickness). For GC/MS detection, an electron ionization system with ionization energy of 70 eV (electron volt) was used. Helium is used as a carrier gas at a
constant flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column oven temperature is initially held at 60 °C and then increased by
5 °C/min to 200 °C hold 2 min then increased to 280 °C
(10 °C /min).

Elemental analysis and high heating value (HHV)
calculation

Elemental composition of crude oils (C, H, N, O, S) were
determined using Agilent model elemental analyzer
(7800 ICP-MS) and HHV was calculated using modified
Dulong equation (Bousdira et al. 2014):

Gas chromatography (GC)

The profiles of WCO was determined by GC with capillary column DB-5 (60 m: ID 0.33 mm). Helium was used
as a carrier gas at flow rate 1 ml/min, column temperature was kept at 240 o143 C for 30 min.
Preparation of (10%) biojet fuel blend testing

Blend of jet A-1 (kerosene) with 10% of produced biojet
from WCO was subjected to a jet engine test (Jet-Cat
80/120) Fig. 4 and the resulted thrust was compared with
that obtained from jet A-1.

Results and discussion
Physicochemical properties of waste cooking oil

The chemical composition (wt%) and physical characterization of WCO are given in Table 2 from which it is clear
that the composition and properties of WCO indicated
that the fuel produced from the feedstock are regarded as
environmentally benign green fuels; the acidity of the oils
is within the acceptable range, insuring that oil does not
contain any corrosive materials which confirm high quality of oil. The iodine value of WCO was 76 g of ­I2/100 g
oil, indicating that the oil contained many unsaturated
C=C bonds as linoleic acid.

Catalyst characterization

From elemental analysis, oxygen content was small
and nitrogen was negligible and no presence of sulfur
was detected. Magnitude of HHV was 13.7 MJ/kg for
WCO as shown in Table 2 which indicated that it is
quite good for fuel production.

In thermal catalytic cracking (TCC) process the type
of catalyst is one of the most important factors that
affect the composition of the product (Prussi et al.
2019). Zinc Aluminate (­ ZnAl2O4) is the catalyst in this
study due its effectiveness in decreasing H/C ratio less
than other metallic oxide catalyst (Xu et al. 2016). This
indicates that the product of thermal cracked oil via

­Z nAl2O4 was not only aromatic compound but more
saturated alkanes (Hanafi et al. 2015).
BET surface area and particle size of the used
­Z nAl2O4 freshly prepared is shown in Table 3.
The particle size and morphology of Z
­ nAL2O4 nano
particle were investigated by using transmission electron microscope (TEM). It was noticed that the particle size possess a narrow size distribution and the
average particle diameter was about 7.6 nm. The
specific surface area measured by the BET method
is relatively high (85 m2/g) which is beneficial due to
its catalytic activity. These data are in good agreement with previous work (Weng et al. 2015) where
Ni-HZSM-5/SBA-15 catalyst of diameter 8.7 nm was
effective in converting large molecular biomass (sorbitol) into small molecule hydrocarbons so the co-precipitation method confirms that it is the best method
for the preparation of Z
­ nAl2O4 as solid nanoparticles.
The overall process for the preparation of the
­Z nAL2O4 from ­AL3+ and Zn 2+ nitrate using ammonium hydroxide is illustrated by the following
equation:

Effect of reaction time

The results showed a linear relationship between time
and freezing point Fig. 5, where the freezing point
reached its lower value after (60 min) reaction time. The
freezing points of the products was considered as a good
indication of the reactant conversion to the biojet fuel,
the reaction can be represented by the Eq. (a) which are
linear relationships between freezing point (Fp.) and time
(t) for WCO hydro catalytic cracking.

(a)

From the previous data, it can be concluded that the
acceptable freezing points for fuel product are obtained
within 60 min. This result gave a promising potential in
the bio aviation manufacture starting from WCO due to
economic and environmental purposes, being of lower
cost than vegetable oils and environmentally positive way
for using oil wastes.
Results of the distillation steps

Parameters affecting the thermal catalytic cracking Process
Effect of temperature

Thermal cracking of WCO was investigated at different temperatures from 400 to 450 °C. The products
were preliminary evaluated by measuring their freezing
points (Oliveira et al. 2018).
High reaction temperature (400–450 °C) was the optimum to crack long chain of oils (tri glycerides > C8–
C16) to give shorter chain (C8–C16) which are the
main constituents of bio aviation to assure reaching
properties in a good agreement compared to those of
petroleum-based jet fuel.
By measuring freezing point, it was found that
increasing the reaction temperature improves the
freezing point of the product Table 4.

Fractions obtained from distillation procedure are shown
in Fig. 3 which illustrated that the bio gasoline product
was collected up to 150 °C while biojet fuel range was
obtained from 150 to 290 °C then finally bio diesel fuel
was produced from 290 to 350 °C.
Thermal cracking of WCO under optimum conditions
gave about 96% crude bio fuel. After the distillation step
of crude bio fuel, about 49% of bio aviation fraction was
obtained and the rest (51%) were biodiesel and heavy
fuel with calorific values suitable as bio fuel to be used in
other purposes. These results are in good agreement with
ASTM standards (Dai et al. 2018).
GC/mass spectra results

The formation of alkanes, cycloalkanes, iso alkanes and
alkyl benzene during thermal catalytic cracking of WCO
was investigated by GC/mass to classify hydrocarbons
present in the product feedstock. The results showed
that: the hydrocarbon mixture contained n-paraffin, iso

(2,2,4-trimethylpentane) in the total product. This is in
agreement with the literature (57.01%) (Holladay 2015b).

iso, cyclo-paraffin have one or two branches as methyldecane, and straight chain alkanes or branched chain cycloalkane as iso octane.
Molecules as methyldecane (iso-paraffin) are much
more represented in petroleum jet fuel component than
iso-octane (branched alkane). Jet fuel range iso-paraffin
is the most expensive and difficult component to obtain,
was detected in good ratio in the prepared bio aviation
fuel.
Pure fuel is highly dependent on the amount of
branched alkanes because increase in branching suppresses the fuel ignition point (Eldeeb 2007).
Biojet blend (10%) test

Specifications of 5% blend of biojet from WCO are illustrated in Table 5 and compared with the standards specifications results were within the required limit. The test

The submitting of biofuels into aviation sector must not
alter the aircraft engine performance and the fuel must
keep its properties during the wide range of atmospheric
conditions during flights (ASTM International 2015).

Conclusions
From the study it is concluded that:
• Renewable bio aviation fuel can be produced via thermal catalytic cracking of vegetable oils where conversion of WCO to hydrocarbon range alkanes has been
successfully performed under high temperature and
pressure.
• Biojet fuel obtained from WCO has fairly acceptable
physico-chemical properties compared to those of
petroleum based fuel.
• Adjustment of the hydro catalytic cracking reaction
conditions was used to control quantities and characteristics of produced bio aviation fuel.
• Results of this study revealed that hydrothermal
catalytic cracking of WCO gave convenient freezing
point (− 55 °C) for use as biojet fuel.

• Taking into consideration the economic evaluation
WCO is preferable as raw material for bio aviation
fuel production due to its low cost and its contribution in environmental pollution abatement.
• Bio aviation fuel fraction from (­ C8–C16) was obtained
by fractional distillation of hydrocracking product
from temperature from 120 to 250 °C.
• Blend of 5% bio aviation with jet A-1 (by volume) can
be used in the engine without any modifications and a
successful test of blended bio aviation fuel with 10% bio
