Abstract
This paper describes a new aircraft concept, where all windows, except those for emergency exits, are replaced with simulated
windows, which consist of monitors connected to external cameras to overcome the discomfort for the passenger due to
the absence of real windows. This concept is developed through an analytical method to estimate the potential advantages
for the environment and for airline companies deriving from a windowless configuration for a short-medium range aircraft,
within the boundaries of the preliminary design. Actually, the reduction in weight is directly linked to the reduction in fuel
consumption, providing advantages in terms of operating costs and emissions of carbon dioxide. The method is applied to
four models of short and medium range aircraft, namely Boeing 737–800, Airbus 320, ATR72 and Embraer 190. The results
show the benefits of a windowless configuration that become very positive for the operating life of an aircraft and the total
fleet, potentially leading to the saving of millions of tons of carbon dioxide every year when applied to the whole fleet of the
analyzed aircraft.

1 Introduction
The increase in air traffic is expected to grow with an annual
trend of 4.3%, in the next 20 years, in accordance with the
Airbus Global Market Forecast 2019–2038;1 thus, there is a
greater focus on the environmental impact generated by the
transport sector. In this perspective, much research is aimed
at defining and developing new designs and technologies
to reduce fuel consumption and, consequently, of polluting
emissions. This trend is well explained in the work of Frota
[1], in particular the authors believe the “classical” aircraft
configurations inhibit innovative practices and to ensure a
growth in the aviation sector radical changes in the way we
design and operate aircraft are required. A similar thesis can
be found in the work of Jupp [2].
In this paper, we consider the short-medium range aircraft
category (single-aisle), whose sales are expected to account
for 76% of the new aircraft deliveries in the next 20 years

(Airbus Global Market Forecast 2019–2038). For example,
Kaparos et al. [3] analyzed a design methodology for a box
wing aircraft, applying the method to the Airbus A320. Welstead et al. [4] explore the design space of the single-aisle
commercial transport concept with a turboelectric propulsion system architecture to evaluate the reduction in fuel
consumption.
In the windowless configuration, the reduction in aircraft
weight, and consequently, the decrease in fuel consumption,
is caused by the removal of windows and their reinforcements
and, indirectly, by the possibility of lightening the whole
aircraft systems.
In literature, the windowless concept has been occasionally studied through three different configurations:
• windowless cockpit in the works of Zaneboni et al. [5]
and of Berth et al. [6];
• windowless fuselage used on blended wing body aircraft
by Liebeck [7] and Van Der Voet et al. [8];
• windowless fuselage in traditional passenger aircraft by
Bagassi et al. [9–11].

In the first configuration, the windscreen is removed and
replaced by monitors connected with external cameras and

sensors to guarantee a 360o view. These technologies are
studied as a further development of ECVFIS (Enhanced
Cockpit Visual and Flight Information System). The second configuration consists in the replacement of windows
with monitors on blended wing body aircraft, where it is
impossible to have openings due to the particular shape of
the wing-fuselage structure. The last concept includes passenger aircraft exploiting a traditional configuration, where
the windows along the fuselage are removed. This third category results more feasible than the previous configurations,
in fact:
• it does not require a complete redesign of the fuselage
and of the manufacturing process;
• it could be studied on the existing cabin design;
• from a passenger point of view, aircraft internal layout is
apparently the same, if compared to a traditional cabin.

Beyond the structural advantages and benefits in terms
of consumption, passenger comfort is a key issue. Therefore, to overcome the sense of claustrophobia, passengers
should stay in a totally closed space without the possibility
to look outside, windows are replaced by monitors connected
with external cameras. It is considered to implement OLED
(Organic Light Emitting Diode) screens, as this technology
is very efficient in terms of electrical consumption, weight,
and realism, compared to the projected image. Monitors, connected with external cameras, show the aircraft outside view
and they are partially covered by an internal frame to recreate the elliptical shape of windows and to provide a sense
of perspective as it is described by Bagassi et al. in [9] and
shown in the model in Fig. 1. Thanks to this concept, it will
be possible to provide many additional features, such as:
• check the ground around the aircraft to be clear of FOD
(Foreign Object Debris);
• evaluate damage to engine or to other external parts of
the aircraft;
• provide passengers with additional information about
weather conditions, route and aircraft position;

123

• provide the crew with a quickly way of communicating
with passengers and vice versa directly through the monitors.

In the following sections, the advantages of this concept will
be analyzed by describing the preliminary design methods
and tools used and discussing the results obtained considering four short and medium range aircraft models (Airbus 320,
Boeing 737–800, ATR72 and the Embraer 190). In fact, the
aim of this paper is to create an analytical method, in the preliminary design field, to estimate the weight reduction and,
consequently, the emissions and operating costs saving, of
an existing passenger aircraft exploiting a windowless configuration.

2 Method and tools
In the windowless configuration, aircraft weight reduction
is considered compared to a traditional aircraft, removing windows reinforcements. In the proposed approach, the
reduction of weight is considered as a function of the number
of windows. The preliminary design is conceived considering
a medium range aircraft.
As an initial approximation, the aerodynamics performance of the aircraft is considered as a constant.

2.1 Background equations
To define an analytical method it is necessary to identify some
statistical relations between the number of windows and the
aircraft length, both of the fuselage and of the cabin. These
equations serve to relate the number of windows statically
with some important parameters in the following method.
This, so that we obtain a final curve that gives a preliminary
trend of the weight reduction as a function of the number of
windows.
The following equations are derived by interpolating a
sample of ten different aircraft models with a single aisle
deck:

The linear relationship between the shape factor of the fuselage F = L/d and the shape factor of the cabin Fc = L c /d,
is obtained by interpolating the same sample of aircraft models, Fig. 2c:

F = 1.3 · Fc + 0.2.

In this case we choose a linear interpolations in accordance
with the work of Torenbeek [12] and update it.
Finally a qualitative relationship between take-off weight
WT O [kg] and the number of windows on one side of the
aircraft Nw/2 is derived, Fig. 2d:

(4)

These previous equations have only statistical value, they
do not want to define a physical correlation between the
number of windows and the various parameters. In fact the
number of windows in the passenger cabin is not a continuous
function of aircraft general parameters but the result of the
frame interval along the longitudinal axis and this interval is
well known (it depends on the aircraft model). The number
of windows is a design data and not a parameter and it is,
about, one per half meter independently from the number of
the side by side seats and the number of aisles.

Weight reduction is the algebraic sum of the weight of the
removed elements as panes, metal frames and longitudinal
reinforcements, and of added elements, as the visual system
and the alloy necessary to “refill” the holes and the part of
stringer that were absent due to the presence of the windows
in the traditional cabin.
Considering an aircraft with Nw elliptical windows where
a and b are the major and the minor semi-axis respectively,
L c the length of the passenger cabin, d the fuselage width, t
its thickness and ρa the aluminium alloy density, it is possible
to write the equations for each component.
The weight of panes W p can be expressed as:
(5)

in which A = a · b · π is the area of a window, t1 , t2 and t3
the thickness of the three panes of a window (pressure pane,
safety pane and dust cover), ρlex and ρ plex the densities of
the materials of the panes (Lexan and Plexiglas).
Windows are openings on the fuselage surface and they
weaken the structure. For this reason, the fuselage must be
reinforced with external reinforcements. The size of the reinforcements are not easy to find for every aircraft model, so
a preliminary method is necessary to estimate it. The lack
of data makes it difficult (if not impossible) to create a FEM
model, inside a reverse engineering process. Moreover, we
prefer to use an analytical equation to simplify the process.
However, to the authors’ knowledge, there are not more
recent publications than that of Mansfield [13] to estimate
the reinforcements size. In this paper, the author describes
a case study on an aircraft of the same category of those
analyzed in this work.
The neutral hole theory [13] is used to size all the elements
in absence of actual data. Therefore, it is possible to estimate
the weight of:

123

Wr = 2 · L c · (tr − t) · w · ρ;

(6)

• the metal frames W f , around each window:
Wf =

√
2 · k · A0 · b · ρa · Nw ,

(7)

where k = a/b and A0 is the area of the compacted
reinforcement in which the loads are maximum.
Then the weight of the material necessary to “refill” the holes,
Wa , is the product of the window volume and alloy density:

2.2 Weight reduction

W p = Nw · A · [ρlex · (t1 + t2 ) + ρ plex · t3 ],

• the two longitudinal reinforcements Wr with a thickness
tr and a height w:

Wa = A · t · ρa · Nw .

(8)

The weight of the “added” parts of the stringers Ws is
given by the product of the stringers part volume Vs and
alloy density:
Ws = Vs · ρa · Nw .

(9)

Finally, the weight of monitors, cameras and connective
cables, Wmc :
Wmc = (Wm · Nm + Wc · Nc ) · X

(10)

in which X is the coefficient that represents the weight of the
cables to connect each monitor and cameras as fraction of the
weight of the visual system (generally from 10% to 40%).
This factor strongly depends on the type of connection, in
series or single, and whether there is an external elaborating
system or not. The weight of one monitor Wm and one camera
Wc depends on the chosen technology. The number of monitors Nm was calculated considering they cover the whole
space along the passenger cabin, except those occupied by
doors, emergency exits, galleys and toilets. The following
equation was used:
Nm = 2 ·

L ec
Lc − Le
=2·
Lm
Lm

(11)

in which L ec is the effective cabin length, expressed as the
difference of the cabin length L c and length not coverable
with monitors L e . L m is the length of one monitor.
The number of cameras Nc is considered twice the number
of windows in order to obtain a wide view of the outside in
any flight phase and for any attitude angle. The cameras are
arranged as in Fig. 3c to exploit the greater horizontal FOV
(Field of View) in the cameras (all commercial cameras have
a greater horizontal FOV than vertical FOV). There are blind
spots in the outside scene near the aircraft surface, but we

827

Fig. 3 Camera position and FOV (Field Of View) [mm]. a Camera horizontal FOV. b Camera vertical FOV. c Camera position on the fuselage

must consider that there are no objects to focus or to see
in the immediate surroundings. A preliminary estimation of
the field of view and blind spots is reported in Fig. 3a, b.
Images must be re-elaborated by a software to have a single
outside scene, coherent for each virtual window. Moreover
the visual system is developed using existing technologies.
In a following phase new technologies for aeronautical use
must be developed and certified, both from a physical and
electronic point of view. Finally the monitors and cameras
design, as size and position, could be changed following the
airlines evaluation.
Therefore the total reduction in weight is the algebraic
sum of added and removed components:
W = W p + Wr + W f − Wa − Ws − Wmc .

(12)

The variation in weight W is mostly affected by the following design parameters:
• number of windows Nw , which affects the W p , W f , Wa ,
Ws and Nc and Nm so Wmc ;

• cabin length L c , which affects Wr and Wmc ;
• fuselage width d which affects Wr .
Figure 4 represents the reduced weight is represented for different fuselage widths, according to the number of windows
and using equation (2) to define the cabin length as a function
of the number of windows.
Because of the so-called “snowball effect,” it is supposed,
as an initial approximation, that the total weight reduction is
increased by 25% compared to that saved in the preliminary
design phase. A deeper analysis could be made using the
relations in [12] for the three systems most affected by the
empty weight reduction:
• wing group;
• landing gear group;
• control surfaces group.
The weight of the wing group is a function of the zero-fuel
weight, the wing geometry and the ultimate load factor. We
consider the wing geometry to be constant and, as a result,

(15)

Therefore, because of monitors and cameras, the fuel consumption is given by the following equation:
ṁ P = k p · S FC · (Nc · Pc + Nm · Pm )

(16)

where Pc and Pm are the power consumption of camera and
monitor respectively.

2.4 Numerical implementation
Fig. 4 Weight reduction in relation of the removed windows for different fuselage diameters

the wing aerodynamics remains as is, also because changing
wing surface or thickness would change the volume of the
wing tanks. The ultimate load factor is constant for the range
of analyzed aircraft. The zero-fuel weight Wz f varies with
the empty weight We (the payload and crew weight does not
change):
0.7
Wwg ∝ Wz0.7
f ∝ We

(13)

The weight of the landing gear group (both the main gear
and the nose gear) and of the control surfaces group are nonlinear functions of the take-off weight and consequently of
the empty one.

2.3 Fuel consumption due to monitors and cameras
The visual system consumes electrical power and consequently fuel. To estimate the fuel consumption linked
to electrical power consumption, the method proposed by
Scholtz et al. in [14] is used. The flow of the fuel ṁ P depends
on the shaft power factor k P , the thrust specific fuel consumption S FC and the power P needed by the device:
ṁ P = k P · S FC · P.

(14)

The first two parameters of the second term in the equation
are specific characteristics of the aircraft, S FC is constant
for a given engine at cruise speed, a typical value of today’s
jet engines in cruise flight is 1.6·10−5 kg/(N ·s). The variable
k P is calculated considering statistical equation by [14], as a
function of the altitude h and the Mach’s number M:
k P = 0.0057 + 4.68 · 10−8 ·

123

1
· h − 0.0106 · M
m

In order to evaluate the saved fuel due to the reduction in
weight, the fuel fraction method is used by calculating the
required fuel for each segment of the flight mission through
an iterative process.
Figure 5 shows the block diagram of the code used to
implement the whole method. Aircraft parameters, as sizes
and cruise information, are inputs (blue blocks), while the
outputs (red blocks) are calculated to prove the advantages
introduced by a windowless configuration in terms of emissions and operatiing costs. The termination criterion of the
iterative processes is a tolerance depending on the weight of
the aircraft or on the maximum number of iterations.
The code starts sizing the reinforcements, through the neutral hole theory, Eqs. (6) and (7), panes, Eq. (5), the added
material, Eqs. (8) and (9), and the visual system, through
Eqs. (10) and (11). Afterwards it is possible to estimate the
direct reduction in weight due to the removal of windows.
The indirect reduction can be calculated either as a sum of the
saved weight in each system or approximated as 25% of the
direct reduction (“snowball effect”). Through the fuel fractions method, the reduction in fuel consumption is obtained
(considering a fuel density of 0.804 kg/m3 ), as well as saved
emissions (supposing that one liter of burnt fuel produces
2.531 kilograms of carbon dioxide2 ) and operating costs with
a global medium price of jet fuel of 0.401 $/l.3 Exploiting a
chosen atmosphere model, as ISA 76, it is possible to know
how much the service ceiling is increased. The code can be
applied to turbofan or turboprop aircraft, with the necessary
changes in the fuel fraction method equations. It is also possible to estimate the consumption due to monitors and cameras,
Eqs. (15) and (16).

3.1 Case studies
The reduction in weight is calculated for four common
short-medium range aircraft models: Airbus 320 and Boeing 737–800, ATR-72 and Embraer 190. Table 1 shows the
most important parameters. All windows are removed, except
those of the emergency exits, and replaced with 77” OLED
screens (weight of 1.9 kg and power consumption of 96 W)
connected with small external cameras (weight of 0.076 kg
and power consumption of 2.8 W), the data of the visual system are already shown in Table 2. The weight of the cables
is conservatively considered 30% of the weight of the visual
system. The fuel consumption of the visual system after one
hour, considering all cameras and monitors on, is reported in
Fig. 6.
The direct reduced weight is 392 kg for A320, 351 kg for
B737, 162 for E190 and 102 kg for ATR72 so the fuselage is
almost 20% lighter. It has to be considered that for each kilogram saved in the preliminary design, approximately 1.25
kilograms are saved in the final project (“snowball effect”).

results, for the three systems affected, and the total reduction
in weight. Despite the great number of windows and the long
passenger cabin, the B737 presents a lower reduced weight
due to the narrower fuselage, which is the most influencing
parameter. The results are more predictable for the ATR and
the Embraer models, that are smaller than the Boeing and
the Airbus models. As expected, the bigger it is the aircraft
the higher is the advantage provided by a windowless configuration. In Fig. 7, the reduction in weight is compared as
a function of the Max Take-off Weight WT O .

3.2 Emissions and costs
The reduction in fuel consumption is assessed using the fuel
fraction method. The A320 saves 0.024 liters per kilometer, the B737 0.022 l/km, the ATR72 0.009 l/km and the
E190 0.010 l/km. Furthermore, assuming that for one liter
of fuel, 2.53 kilograms of CO2 are emitted, a windowless
A320 approximately saves 0.06 kilograms of CO2 per kilometer, the B737 0.55 kg/km, the ATR72 0.02 kg/km and the
E190 0.03 kg/km. These results become encouraging considering the number of aircraft currently in operation. There are
4111 A320s, 4258 B737s, 991 ATR72s and 546 E190s, consequently the daily emission saving would be 1.89 million
kilograms of CO2 for the A320, 1.78 million for the B737,
76.6 thousand kilograms for the ATR72 and 101.9 thousand
for the E190. The annual emission reduction for the number
of aircraft of each model currently in operation is reported in
Fig. 8.
In terms of operating costs, flying with a windowless A320
and B737 would be cheaper by respectively 0.01 and 0.009
dollars per kilometer, with the ATR72 by 0.0038 $/km and
with the E190 by 0.0042 $/km. A medium-haul aircraft,
exploiting a windowless configuration, as average of A320
and B737, produces 0.70% less polluting emissions than a
traditional one and it is 0.72% cheaper. A regional turboprop,
such as the ATR72, is 0.5% cheaper. A short-range aircraft,
such as the E190, is 0.34% cheaper. Considering the number
of aircraft currently in operation, the daily dollar saving is
around 309 thousand for A320s and 292 thousand for B737s;
for the ATR72 and E190, a saving of 12 and 16 thousand
respectively can be considered. The annual operating cost
saving for the number of aircraft of each model currently in
operation is reported in Fig. 9.

For the four aircraft models, the value of fuel consumption

4 Conclusions
This paper proposes an analysis on the preliminary design of
a windowless concept with the aim to assess the reduction in
fuel consumption and the associated emissions, limiting the
passenger discomfort due to the absence of real windows.
Important findings are obtained, both in terms of numerical
and analytical results:
• there is an effective reduction in weight (and, consequently, in fuel consumption), considering both the
removed and added elements from the fuselage;
• the method could easily estimate the weight reduction
for different short-medium range aircraft models, with
negligible computational costs and using accessible data.
In fact, this work has tried to highlight the advantages of
a windowless concept applied to a traditional fuselage, filling the gap of knowledge, understood as the lack of reliable
methods and results, on this particular configuration.
Moreover, much deeper analysis may find other advantages for this configuration and find a way to overcome some
of its major issues:
• the dynamic effect on the window reinforcements and
interactions between windows and other openings, such
as doors, referring to the analysis [15], moreover dynamic
analyses on the monitors must be performed to understand if there is the need to add reinforcements against
vibrations;
• the fatigue effects on aircraft without openings;
• the modifications to aerodynamic performance. In fact,
aside from the drag reduction due to the removal of
windows (likely negligible), the wing surface could be
decreased, choosing to embark less fuel, with a lower
aerodynamic drag;
• reduction in noise inside the cabin, increasing the passenger comfort. A first study, at low frequency and for
a regional turboprop aircraft, was already conducted by
Moruzzi e al. [16];
• tailored interiors design could help passengers to accept
the new configuration, with wider and interactive screens;
• in the mid-term future, the visual system concept could be
improved with eye tracker devices or augmented reality
devices till a complete removal of monitors;
• from a manufacturing point of view a fuselage without
holes is cheaper than one with a hole. Further studies
could quantify this saving. Moreover, a windowless aircraft could have less maintenance costs.

831

Beyond these technological and economic considerations, the proposed concept could provide a contribution to
the global strategies of reducing air pollution through the
restraint of the emissions of the aviation industry.
