AbstractA powerful pulsed dc converter has been developed for charging battery assemblies on board of hybrid and electric aircraft, which enables full battery capacity charging in cruise mode of the aircraft. This 10-kW modular design converter can operate in a buck–boost mode in a voltage range of 130–300 V with a current limit of 70 A at an output voltage of 150 V. The efficiency of the created converter is ~96–99%, depending on the power consumed in the load. The proposed modular design and multiphase control circuit can be used to create converters with different capacities and high efficiency.
