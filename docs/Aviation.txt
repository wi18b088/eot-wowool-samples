matrix composites that are significantly superior in specific
strength, modulus, and fatigue resistance. Fighters such as the
F22 and the Eurofighter use up to 70% composite materials by
weight (Figure 2), and commercial aircraft such as the Boeing
787 use nearly 50%.8 The Airbus A380 design is more conservative in materials usage, but still employs an aluminum alloy–
carbon fiber/polymer matrix composite sandwich configuration
extensively for primary structures.9 The structural efficiencies of
airframes could be improved through increased sophistication in
the manufacturing of polymer matrix composites. Automated
textile weaving processes that precisely control fiber spacing,
directionality, dimensionality, and volume fraction can be utilized to allow designs that provide local rather than global
responses to loads. Co-curing and co-bonding processes together
with localized joining through electron beam or irradiation curing will eliminate metallic fasteners and rivets, thus providing
increased structural integrity in addition to a reduction in weight.
The temperature capabilities of polymer matrix composites need
to be enhanced from their current limits of about 525 K, through
molecular engineering or perhaps the use of matrix and fiber
surfaces modified with carbon nanotubes, enabling further
replacement of metallic parts in hotter sections of aircraft at temperatures higher than 600 K. A key challenge in this task will lie
in ensuring that the toughness (about 0.04 design compression
strain) and environmental resistance do not degrade with increasing temperature capabilities.
Increases in fuel efficiency have, of course, been derived
from aerodynamics. The challenge has always been to resolve
the conflicting demands of wing design to reduce induced drag
(arising from wing tip vortices) in the low-speed regime to parasitic (form, skin friction, and interference components) and
supersonic wave drag effects that increase exponentially with
speed. Concepts that seek to maintain laminar flow over the
wing profile6 and a variety of wing profiles and geometries that

Aviation accounts for about 3% of the current global energy
consumption of 15 terawatts (TW).1–3 The global annual growth
of energy use in the aviation sector is likely to be around 2.15%
and will exceed that in other transportation sectors, although
land transport will continue to consume the largest amounts of
fuel. Figure 1 displays the historical improvements in energy
efficiency in the aviation sector.4 Fuel use is determined by both
operational and technological factors.5–7 The former includes
the passenger load factor, ground efficiencies, taxi procedures,
take-off and landing paths and circuitry (actual distance traveled versus a great-circle distance), and changes in the mixture
of old and new aircraft and propulsion systems with time.
Technology factors, focusing on materials issues, are described
in greater detail herein.

Technology

The Breguet range equation (Equation 1) provides metrics for
the evaluation of technology factors contributing to fuel efficiency
aircraft range = (velocity/SFC) u(lift/drag) u
ln[1 + Wf /(Wpl + Wo)]

(1)

where SFC is the fuel consumption per unit thrust of the propulsion system, Wf is the fuel weight, Wpl is the payload weight,
and Wo is the empty operating weight. Improvements in technology derive from aerodynamics (that is, an increase in the
lift-to-drag ratio for various flight conditions), increases in the
propulsive and thermodynamic efficiencies of gas turbine
engines, and reductions in airframe and engine weights.7

Airframe

Increases in fuel efficiency due to weight reduction of airframes were estimated to be between 2.5% and 7.5% from a
10% decrease in aircraft weight.6 The prime airframe material,
aluminum, has been gradually replaced by carbon fiber/polymer

reduce drag over differing flight regimes have been evaluated,
including most recently the Boeing unmanned blended-wing
aircraft, which uses a flat, wide body that tapers out to thin wing
tips. These designs will culminate in adaptive or morphing
wings that acquire optimal configurations during flight much
like the wings of a bird. The realization of such advanced concepts will demand an intensely multidisciplinary effort, combining aerodynamics, control, sensors, and actuation, and will
require the use of multifunctional materials systems that combine structural functions with those of sensing and actuation.
Thus, materials ranging from piezoelectrics to shape-memory
materials, magnetostrictive materials, and electroactive polymers will play a significant role (Table I) in the sensors and
actuators of such morphing wings. Their choice will be determined by their frequency, stress and strain, and hysteresis
response.10 Skin materials (which are largely polymer matrix
composites) of such morphing wings will combine with novel
structural forms11 to be sufficiently elastic to deform reversibly
but stiff enough to withstand aerodynamic loads.

Propulsion

Two key concepts have driven performance and efficiency
improvements in gas turbines. The thrust-specific fuel consumption has steadily improved through increases in the
bypass ratio (the fraction of the total airflow through the fan of
the engine that directly contributes to thrust without being
burned with fuel to drive the turbine) from the turbojet configuration. It has been estimated that the ultra-high-bypass configuration might contribute as much as 10% to efficiencies in
seat miles per gallon.6 Further improvements in propulsive
efficiency will arise from the geared turbofan concept, which
sets fan and low-pressure turbine rotor speeds to their respective optimal values for very high bypass ratios, and from variable-cycle-engine concepts. The turboprop also has a very high
efficiency, albeit at much lower aircraft speeds. An alternative
pathway lies in the use of the unducted fan (without a casing)
or the propfan, which combine the efficiencies of the turboprop
with the thrust of a turbofan, an approach being pursued by
Rolls Royce in a European consortium. Significant materials
innovation has kept engine weights down even as engine sizes

have increased to accommodate greater thrust and bypass
ratios. The most striking of these innovations are the use of
wide-chord, hollow titanium fan blades in Rolls Royce’s Trent
engines and the use of polymer matrix composite fan blades in
the GE 90 and GEnx engine, as well as polymer matrix composite front casing in the GEnx engine. The GEnx engine also
represents probably the first service use of the G-TiAl intermetallic compound in replacement for nickel-based blades in the
low-pressure turbine.12
Engine weights have also been kept down through increases
in the thermodynamic efficiency of the engine that enable
higher thrust for the same mass flow and through the development of high-temperature materials for the turbine. The temperature capability of turbine airfoils used today, made of a
single-crystal nickel-based superalloy, coated with a thermal
barrier, and cooled internally, approaches 1800 K, but improvements are becoming increasingly harder to obtain. The elimination of cooling can provide further enhancements in efficiency.
Ultra-high-temperature materials represented by those shown
in Figure 3 (that is, intermetallic compounds based on Mo–Si
and Nb–Si, platinum-group metals, SiC/SiC ceramic matrix
composites, or even A12O3/GdA12O3 eutectic composites) provide possibilities in this direction, perhaps allowing increases
of about 100 K.13 The use of higher turbine entry temperatures,
in turn, demands higher temperature capabilities in low-pressure turbine and compressor materials. Advanced cores using
G-TiAl and orthorhombic intermetallic composites and monoliths have been evaluated, as have SiC/SiC composites for combustors.14,15 Weight reductions enabled by integrated blading on
disks of titanium alloys (rotor disk and blades machined from a
solid piece of material, as opposed to mechanically joined configurations) are now standard on modern fighter engines, as are
SiC/SiC or C/SiC composite materials on nozzles and other jet
pipe parts.

Conclusion

Innovations in materials technology, primarily through the
increasing use of polymer matrix composites and titanium, have
played a key role in decreasing airframe and propulsion system
weights, even while enabling higher thrust levels through the
use of materials that can withstand very high temperatures.
Smart, multifunctional materials will also play a role in enabling
adaptive aerodynamic concepts for greater flight efficiency.
Although the driver for improvements in energy efficiency in the

aviation sector has usually been the high cost of jet fuel, other
factors such as the depletion of fossil fuel reserves and global
warming will increasingly dominate. About 60% of aircraft
emissions are in the upper troposphere, and 20% are in the
stratosphere; these emissions are unregulated. Alternative fuels,
such as biofuels and hydrogen, and alternative propulsion systems based on fuel cells are being evaluated in response to these
drivers. These will be associated with a different set of materials
challenges, as will the reemergence of supersonic transport and
possible development of hypersonic transport. The advent of
unmanned air vehicles will provide relatively safe opportunities
to test advanced technologies. It is possible that improvements
in energy intensity in the aviation sector will continue to outpace
those in the automobile sector, as has been the case in the past.
