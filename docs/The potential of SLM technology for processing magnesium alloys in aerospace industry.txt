Abstract
Selective Laser Melting (SLM) of magnesium alloys is the technology undergoing dynamic development in many research
centres. The results are promising and make it possible to manufacture defect-free material with better properties than those
offered by the manufacturing technologies used to date. This review aims to evaluate present state as well as main challenges
of using Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) for processing magnesium alloys as an alternative way to conventional technologies to manufacture parts in the aerospace industry. This literature review is the first one to outline information concerning
the potential to use magnesium alloys in the aerospace industry as well as to summarise the results of magnesium alloy processing using AM technologies, in particular L-PBF. The available literature was reviewed to gather information about: the
use of magnesium alloys in the aerospace industry—the benefits and limitations of using magnesium and its alloys, examples
of applications using new processing methods to manufacture aerospace parts, the benefits and potential of using L-PBF to
process metallic materials, examples of the use of L-PBF to manufacture aerospace parts, and state-of-the-art research into
L-PBF processing of magnesium and magnesium alloys.

1 Introduction
Over 80% of all innovations in the aerospace industry owe
their existence to the use of new materials and new technologies [1]. Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies that are
used to manufacture parts of both plastics and metals are
one example of the technologies that have been developed
since the 1980s. Presently, AM technologies are increasingly applied for the manufacture of ready-made parts both
as indirect [2] and direct [3] technologies. Despite the significant progress that has been made in the field and a wide

range of potential applications, they are not commonly used
in the industry.
Aviation is a substantial industry and one of the key
transport modes these days. It is then of crucial importance
to reduce fuel consumption for reasons of economy and to
decrease combustion product emission due to environmental concerns. New alternative fuels, as well as improved
engines and aerodynamic components, are one way to
achieve these goals. However, weight reduction is the easiest and most cost-effective option that necessities the search
for new, lighter, and high-strength construction materials
and new manufacturing technologies [4]. Plastics, composites, and light metallic alloys are materials that meet these
requirements.
Magnesium and magnesium alloys are one of the lightest metallic materials. Their low density of 1.73 g/cm3 and
the resulting high specific strength make them a perfect
alternative to slightly heavier aluminium alloys. The use of
light alloys in aviation will result in reduced aircraft weight,
which in turn means reduced fuel consumption as well as
combustion product emission to the atmosphere. As early
as in the 1940s and 1950s, researchers saw the advantages
of using magnesium alloys in aviation and identified new

application fields [5, 6]. Certain limitations and differences
between the use of magnesium materials and the then commonly used aluminium alloys were also considered at that
time [7]. One of the recent findings in this field is that compared to aluminium alloy 2017A, the AZ31 magnesium alloy
is more resistant to low-cycle fatigue as well as high-cycle
fatigue at stresses lower than 150 MPa [8]. Since the densities of magnesium alloys and plastics are similar, Mg alloys
also take the place of plastics to ensure higher stiffness [9].
Magnesium alloys are not developing dynamically,
mainly due to the processing difficulties which result from
magnesium being highly oxidisable and hardly susceptible
to plastic cold forming due to its compact hexagonal crystallographic structure. Alloys doped with rare earth elements
are a promising group of magnesium alloys as they offer
better mechanical properties, also at elevated temperatures,
and better corrosion resistance [10]. Similar to other materials, the properties of magnesium alloys can be modified by
heat treatment, grain size reduction, production of composites, or surface layer modification [9, 11]. Purging a molten
metal with inert gases (Ar, SF6) in the casting process alone
reduces the number of contaminants in the material and
increases material elongation from 4 to 7% [12]. An additional problem in the processing of magnesium alloys is the
risk of ignition and difficult extinguishing both at elevated
temperature and when the material is loose; for example, it
has the form of powder or chips [13]. Due to safety reasons
caused by the risk of ignition, the use of magnesium alloys
in cabin structure was prohibited [14]. That is why a more
extensive use of magnesium alloys in the aerospace industry is hindered, in contrast to the automotive or electronic
industry.
The purpose of this review was to map the current state
of research aimed at implementing L-PBF in the aerospace
industry to manufacture parts from magnesium alloys. Such
review is necessary considering aerospace industry’s growing interest in light alloys, including magnesium alloys, the
use of new technologies to improve magnesium alloy performance, considerable progress in the development of AM
technologies, and studies that confirmed the suitability of
magnesium alloys to be processed by L-PBF.

allow the use of magnesium alloys in components of the
passenger cabin interior [15] (Fig. 1). Flammability tests
conducted in line with the FAA guidelines [16] for a seat
assembly consisting of five components made of magnesium
alloys showed that the alloys used did not reduce passenger
safety [17]. In their latest AS8049C performance standard
published in 2015, SAE International changed the provision that banned the use of magnesium alloys in aircraft seat
components and now allows the use of magnesium allows
provided that FAA standards are met [18].
Several alloying elements and their effect on magnesium
ignition were analysed to evaluate the ignition and flammability risks of magnesium alloys [19]. The studies showed
that commercial magnesium alloys modified with rare earth
elements Mg-x-RE have a higher ignition temperature
(780–940 °C).
Wojtas et al. [20] reported fatigue testing results of
AZ31B lever forging designed for the ILX-27 helicopter
designed by the Institute of Aviation (Poland). They successfully substituted the element designed to eventually be made
of an aluminium alloy with a lighter magnesium alloy and
maintained sufficient strength properties in a 100-h simulated flight test. Despite the inferior mechanical properties
of magnesium alloy in comparison with the eventual aluminium alloy, magnesium alloy is a good substitute for PA7
aluminium alloy to aid in the helicopter weight reduction.
Many flat and ribbed aerospace parts are manufactured
from magnesium alloys by casting and machining [21, 22].
Public units also financially support research programs
into the use of magnesium alloys in aerospace. The Sixth
Framework Programme (FP6) of the European Commission
made it possible to complete two large projects with such
major players as EADS Deutschland GmbH (Germany),

2 The use of magnesium alloys
in the aerospace industry
Significant progress in the use of magnesium alloys in the
developing aerospace industry was observed as early as in
the 1940s [5]. Over the last decade, i.e. since the Society of
Automotive Engineers (SAE International) imposed a ban
on magnesium alloy used in aircraft seat construction, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and SAE International
have been working to develop safety standards that would

Airbus (HQ in the Netherlands), Eurocopter (now—Airbus
Helicopters SAS, HQ in France), Israel Aviation Industry
(Israel), Liebherr-Aerospace SAS (France), and Alenia
(Italy).
New and modified magnesium products with material
properties higher than those of the existing aluminium alloys
were developed as a result of these projects [23]. It was possible due to the advances in the magnesium materials forging
technology and surface modification that improved corrosion
resistance up to 60 times. The new forging processes reduced
the costs of manufacturing secondary fuselage components
(e.g. window frames, panels of internal inspection doors),
and the mechanical requirements for aluminium products
were met [24] (Figs. 2 and 3).

3 New achievements in the processing
of magnesium alloys
New technological processes are being developed to promote
the use of magnesium alloys in the industry, take advantage
of their indisputable potential, and improve characteristics
that remain unsatisfactory. Low-strength properties of magnesium alloys when compared to Al and Ti alloys (especially
at elevated temperatures) and low corrosion resistance are
the main factors limiting the use of these materials in the
industry. One of the ways to improve the strength properties
is microstructure refinement which results in superplasticity
in certain alloys (Mg–Al–Zn, Mg–Zn–Zr, and Mg–Li). The
superplastic effect allows freedom to create complex shapes
and makes it possible to produce near net shape structures. It

also improves mechanical properties [25]. Therefore, several
authors have reported using various methods to obtain a finegrained microstructure.
Fine-grained magnesium alloy microstructure can be
achieved using traditional thermo-mechanical treatment
(rolling, extrusion) [26] and equal-channel angular pressing
(ECAP) [27]. The three-slide forging press process made it
possible to manufacture rib elements with complex geometries, save on material costs, and improve the mechanical
properties of the products [21, 28, 29].
Another process which significantly reduced the grain
size was machining with simultaneous cooling of the treated
surface with liquid nitrogen [30]. However, there is a risk
that fine chips that are formed during machining may ignite
[13]. Grain refinement in magnesium alloy after ECAP
process resulted in better mechanical strength, whereas
machining improved the hardness of the near-to-surface
layer almost two times. A similar surface effect is observed
when laser surface treatment is used [11, 31, 32]. Grains
can also be refined during the casting process itself, using
15 Hz frequency ultrasounds to generate vibrations in the
solidifying metal [33].
High current pulsed electron beam (HCPEB) surface
treatment [34] may increase wear resistance up to sevenfold. A similar effect is observed upon applying a coating
by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) [35].
Alloying and formation of composites are the evident
methods that can be used to improve the properties of materials. A small addition of beryllium (a few parts per million) improved AZ91 alloy’s corrosion resistance at elevated
temperature [36] (Fig. 4). The addition of zinc-containing
icosahedral quasicrystalline phase increased hardness by up
to 500% after additional heat treatment [37] at the cost of
higher brittleness of the material. Wang et al. [38] avoided
the formation of the quasicrystalline phase by introducing

zinc and yttrium into AM50 alloy, which maintained the
original properties of the material.
Strengthening of AZ31 alloy with SiC nanoparticles and
carbon nanotubes in the friction stir welding process helped
to refine its microstructure and increase the yield strength
at the cost of tensile and elongation strength [39]. Better
results, which increase the tensile strength, may be achieved
when the alloy is reinforced by carbon fibre [40]. The addition of boron carbides to AZ91D alloy increases hardness
and wear resistance [41]. It was also found that the addition of 50% graphite flakes to pure magnesium increases the
thermal conductivity of the material so that it is four times
higher than the conductivity of copper [42].
A detailed list of technological processes used to modify
the microstructure and properties of magnesium alloys is
shown in Table 1.

4 L‑PBF technology
Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF or SLM/DMLS—Selective Laser Melting/Direct Metal Laser Sintering) is one of
many additive manufacturing technologies. It represents
the powder bed fusion (PBF) group that encompasses many
other technologies. Apart from L-PBF, it includes SLS/
SHS (Selective Laser Sintering/Selective Heat Sintering)
and EBM (Electron Beam Melting). All of the technologies
mentioned above share the principle of operation, that is,
the powder bed is melted as a result of interaction with the
source of energy: either a laser beam (L-PBF/SLM/DMLS,
SLS) or an electron beam (EBM) [43] (Fig. 5). The significant difference between the technologies that employ laser is

13

its power which determines the results of the technological
process, i.e. either sintering (SLS) or complete melting of
the powder material (L-PBF).
Additive manufacturing using powder offers several
advantages over other technologies (e.g. wire feed) which
include better tolerances, better surface finish quality, and
a possibility to create geometrically complex shapes [44].
The process of manufacturing parts using Selective
Laser Melting consists of heating and melting the powder
with a laser beam, followed by rapid cooling and solidification of the melted metal. High-temperature gradient
and high cooling rate generate textured microstructures
of metal alloys, the majority of which are characterised
by columnar grains built of oriented packages of dendrite cells, very fine grains, cellular and interdendritic
microsegregation, and occurrence of non-equilibrium
phases as well as solution strengthening resulting from
supersaturation [45]. However, the solidification conditions of a liquid metal cause negative phenomena, inducing residual stresses [46] and defects taking the form of
pores and various cracks. Laser type and the selection of
variable parameters have a decisive impact on the quality
of the manufactured parts [47]. Over 100 process parameters control L-PBF technology process. Many of them
are fixed depending on machine type, used powder, or is
set for the entire process, like these concerning process
atmospheres, or energy source, but there are also adjustable parameters, in which proper value selections could
tune the process to obtain demanded results. For example,
the widely used high-power continuous-wave (CW) lasers
and parallel long-pulsed lasers (nanosecond to millisecond pulse) are characterised, as opposed to femtosecond

fibre lasers, by lower precision in the manufacture of parts
and use of limited groups of metal alloys—due to a wide
heat-affected zone in the case of metals with high or low
melting point and/or high conductivity [48]. Another factor which also affects the results of manufactured parts is
build strategy, which includes not only the built orientation and position inside the process chamber but also the
scanning strategy for each deposited powder layer [49].
Rashid et al. [50] combined the observations as mentioned
above and proposed the new term—“energy per layer”,
which includes the total area of melted powder on each
layer, that affects the resulted microstructure and porosity
and could describe and control process results.
There are several physical phenomena during the
L-PBF process that are the key factors determining the
quality of the manufactured parts. These include metal
powder absorptivity concerning the laser radiation, balling effect causing discontinuities in the melted metal, and
thermal fluctuations that frequently result in cracking and

hence in the destruction of the component being manufactured [51, 52].
L-PBF is the most frequently used powder bed technique within additive manufacturing for processing aerospace components. In terms of manufacturing organisation
and costs, using additive manufacturing, and in particular
L-PBF, has two main advantages [53]: (1) small batch production does not increase production costs in contrast to
casting technologies, and (2) complex product shape also
does not increase production costs in contrast to conventional (subtractive) technologies.
The most important disadvantages of the parts manufactured using powder bed fusion processes include a potential
lack of melting between the layers and porosity [54]. Some
authors [54, 55] stated that the porosity of over 6% significantly affects the mechanical properties of the metallic materials being manufactured.
The AM technologies outlined above offer the possibility to efficiently use alloying elements and hence obtain

1. It is possible to develop and manufacture a new geometry of the external and internal part, e.g. internal cooling
ducts [44], which is impossible in the case of conventional technologies;
2. Energy efficiency and considerable reduction in time,
material, waste, and other costs associated with the
manufacture of a new part;
3. Less negative environmental impact;
4. Shorter time to market.

new alloys with better mechanical and thermal properties,
and/or with increased resistance to abrasive and corrosive
wear [56]. Moreover, the features of the process such as
layer by layer and selective melting of the powder material enable manufacturing of parts with complex shapes
and any designed (solid or having the designed porosity)
internal geometry [57]. These advantages of AM technologies, and in particular of L-PBF, make them increasingly
popular in the industry. They have gained immense recognition and are most widely used in medical and aerospace
industries which are marked by high demand for custommade products whose final properties can be tailored to the
specific requirements.

5 The use of L‑PBF technology
in the aerospace industry
Examples of aerospace parts manufactured by L-PBF are
shown in Fig. 6. They include a fuel nozzle made of cobalt
alloy [58], borescope made of nickel-based alloy—Inconel
718 [59] and various latches and supports made of titanium alloys. Titanium alloys, e.g. Ti6Al4 V, are well recognised and frequently substitute steel as their use reduces
the buy-to-fly ratio from 15 to 1 [54].
The benefits of using L-PBF in the aerospace industry
are as follows [60]:

13

Topological optimisation is used to take advantage of the
main benefits of L-PBF in the aerospace industry, which
include reduced weight and amount of material needed to
manufacture a specific part. Bamberg et al. [59] reported an
example of such optimisation carried out for an aerospace
part made of aluminium alloy which is subject to three-point
bending (Fig. 6.3–6.5) [59, 61]. However, limitations of
L-PBF technology should be taken into account, especially
brittle fracture behaviour for material without any heat treatment [62].
To conclude, AM technologies are currently used in
the aerospace industry to produce non-critical parts with
complex geometries or for which lighter alloys of satisfactory strength can be used to significantly reduce weight
and ensure topological optimisation of their inner shape.
Examples of parts produced by L-PBF or EBM that were
implemented or partially implemented are listed in Table 2.
However, there are still many challenges to address before
AM technologies, in particular L-PBF, can be fully implemented in the aerospace industry.
1. The main challenge is to ensure stability and repeatability of the process to eliminate internal defects, surface
roughness, and achieve high geometry tolerance [44].
2. Post-processing requirement. It was assumed that each
part produced with the AM technology requires postprocessing to reduce (a) porosity with the use of hot
isostatic pressing (HIP) and/or (b) surface roughness
[71] by surface machining.
3. Certification and standardisation [65, 72]. Lack of methods for verifying the parts produced with AM technologies or standards regarding the terminology, file format,
or processing procedures for various alloys significantly
hinders the implementation of AM technologies.

6 The use of L‑PBF technology
for magnesium processing
The first attempts to melt magnesium-based materials and
produce spatial specimens by L-PBF were reported in
2012 [73]. It was the first report that discussed difficulties

in processing Mg–9%Al alloy with a laser beam and
observed evaporation of magnesium during the process.
A year later, L-PBF was used to produce spatial specimens from AZ91 alloy with almost zero porosity [74].
Gieseke et al. [75] reported similar results for pure magnesium and MgCa0.8 alloy. In this paper, the authors
described the evaporation of magnesium (Fig. 7) and
pointed out that scanning direction affects the resulting
specimen surface quality. They suggested that the scanning
direction is changed for successive layers considering the
good quality of the side surface of specimens, perpendicular to the scanning direction.
The main aim of the study [74] discussed above was
to explore the potential of magnesium alloys as a bioresorbable implant material. Other authors discussed the
problem of low corrosion resistance of magnesium alloys
and reported successful attempts to increase it [76]. In
2015, the options to manufacture scaffolds from WE43
and AZ91 alloys by L-PBF were presented [77] (Fig. 8).

Additionally, Gieseke’s team collaborated with Magnesium Elektron (England) to determine the optimum L-PBF
technology parameters for processing ­Elektron® 43 alloy
[78–80]. The authors reported a considerably reduced porosity in the produced specimens as a result of double scanning of a layer and simultaneous addition of the material
between successive scanning passes of the layer. According
to the authors, residual porosity was the result of a disturbed
flow of the shielding gas that transferred contaminants from
magnesium vapour onto the melted layers. Other authors
[81] established that such contaminants deposited on the
powder surface in the form of oxide layers might result in
weak interlayer bonding.
Due to the oxidation and balling phenomena that accompany L-PBF, Scanning Time Interval (STI) parameter was
analysed, which denotes time delay in the process that
occurs between the completion of a layer scanning and further application and melting of the next layer [82]. When the
time delay between scanning the next layers is of appropriate

length, the produced specimen cools down partially, which
results in better wettability and oxidation resistance of the
material. This also improves the surface quality of the produced specimens by reducing the number of partially melted
powder particles attached to the specimen’s surface.
Pawlak et al. [83, 84] suggested that the design of
experiments methods is used to facilitate the optimisation of the L-PBF process for AZ31 alloy. The high relative densities and high hardness of the alloy that exceed the
values obtained for wrought material further confirm that

13

magnesium alloys are suitable for the L-PBF processing.
In another study of this researcher on magnesium alloys in
L-PBF, a relation between process parameters and obtained
results was presented [85]. Authors reported that significant
influence on obtained material hardness has Laser Power
(LP), which was common observation for L-PBF processing,
while for porosity in defined processing window scanning
speed has a slightly higher influence than laser power.

in impurities of a protective gas atmosphere. This research
is essential for the L-PBF process and points at one more
source of difficulties in manufacturing high-quality parts
from magnesium in powder bed fusion processes.
A list of different analysed materials and obtained microstructures and mechanical properties is listed in Table 3.
The research focused on microstructure, and chemical composition of magnesium-based powders processed
in L-PBF technology reports hard to omit vaporisation,
mainly magnesium element [77, 85, 87, 88]. Because of
rapid cooling rate and high energy input, characteristic
microstructure for magnesium alloys processed in L-PBF
reveals scan track formation with ultrafine microstructure on track centre and coarser grains but still fine on the
boundaries of the formed scan track [85, 89, 90]. Another
parameter influence was evaluated by Savalani et al. [91],
which points that preheating allows to obtain a flatter and
more regular scan track.
The papers discussed above show growing interest in the
production of parts from magnesium alloy by L-PBF. Positive results of studies carried to date as well as promising
properties of such alloys encourage researchers and manufacturers to explore the new application field and new possibilities it brings. Additive manufacturing of light metallic
materials (Mg and Al alloys) that pose processing difficulties
will be studied extensively in the near future.

7 Summary
Magnesium alloys can be used to manufacture parts for the
aerospace industry. The resulting parts are characterised by
good specific strength (due to low weight) and fatigue resistance. Modern technologies, e.g. additive manufacturing,

may help overcome difficulties encountered when processing magnesium alloys.
The methods of shaping magnesium alloy products used
to date such as forging, casting, or equal-channel angular
pressing (ECAP) have many limitations, e.g. no freedom
in shaping a complex geometry of the product, risk of chip
ignition during machining, and ageing process which significantly worsens mechanical properties.
The use of AM technologies, in particular Laser Powder
Bed Fusion (L-PBF), to process magnesium alloys will enable the production of parts of the specific shape in a single
technological process. First, results of studies into L-PBF
processing of magnesium alloys reported by several research
centres are promising. The specimens manufactured have
three-dimensional geometries without porosity or delamination, which had been the primary challenge of additive
processes. However, there remain a few issues to be solved
to ensure successful implementation. The researchers need
to (a) ensure repeatability, (b) eliminate porosity, and (c)
ensure scalability (capability to expand from the production
of small to large parts).
Joint Technology Initiative (JTI) set up by the Advisory
Council for Aeronautics Research in Europe (ACARE,
HQ in Belgium) in the European Union also confirms the
strong interest of aerospace industry in AM technologies
and magnesium-based light alloys [97]. Seven framework
programmes were established as part of this initiative whose
aim was to reduce C
­ O2 and NOx emissions and reduce the
levels of noise produced by aircraft. As a result of the Clean
Sky programme, a few demonstrators were manufactured,
e.g. using Electron Beam Melting, which decreased the
weight of door hinges by 52%. The “Shelf Removal Assembly” demonstrator made of WE43 magnesium alloy, which
decreased the weight by 20% compared to the component
made of 2024 aluminium alloy, is another example.
