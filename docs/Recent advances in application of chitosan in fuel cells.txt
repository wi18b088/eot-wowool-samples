Abstract
Fuel cells are electrochemical devices which convert chemical energy into electrical energy. Fuel cells have attracted
attention due to their potential as a promising alternative to traditional power sources. More recently, efficient and
environmentally benign biopolymer “chitosan” have been extensively investigated as a novel material for its application
in fuel cells. This biopolymer can be used in both membrane electrolyte and electrode in various fuel cells such as
alkaline polymer electrolyte fuel cells, direct methanol fuel cells and biofuel cells. This review provides an overview of
main available fuel cells following by application of chitosan as novel biopolymer in fuel cells technology. Recent
achievements are included and recommendations are also given for areas of future research.

Introduction
The extensive use of fossil fuels has resulted to severe
pollutant emissions, including SOx, NOx, CO, and particulates which pose severe threat to the health of human beings [1]. In addition, a steady depletion of world’s limited
fossil fuel, reserves calls for efficient, benign and sustainable
technologies for energy conversion and power generation.
Fuel cells are among the most efficient and environmental
friendly devices for energy conversion and power generation due to their zero-emission power source [2]. Fuel
cells have been identified as one of the most promising
and potent technologies which meet energy security,
economic growth, and environmental sustainability requirements [2]. Although fuel cell technology has matured substantially over the past decades, technological barriers, such
as insufficient durability, cell life time and fuel cell component costs, still delay commercialization in many applications [3]. There are different types of fuel cells that are
generally characterized by electrolyte material. Among electrolyte material, solid polymer-based electrolyte membranes
offer advantages such as high efficiency and high energy
density [4]. However, polymer electrolyte membrane is the
most expensive component of a polymer electrolyte-based
fuel cell [5]. Therefore, cost effective and eco-friendly

polymer electrolytes from renewable sources can become a
promising substitute for synthetic polymers in fuel cells.
Among natural polymers, polysaccharides are among the
best candidates due to their abundance in environment [5].
Chitosan, as a derivative of chitin, is a naturally abundant
and low-cost biopolymer which has attracted attention in
various scientific and engineering processes due to its excellent biocompatibility, non-toxicity and chemical and thermal stability [6-8]. The presence of amino groups in the
glucosamine residue imparts an additional characteristic
feature to chitosan in comparison to these polysaccharides.
The positive charge arising due to the highly protonated
amino functionalities enables chitosan to form polyelectrolyte complexes spontaneously with a wide variety of
negatively charged polyanions such as lipids, collagen,
glycosaminoglycans, lignosulfonate, and alginate, as well
as charged synthetic polymers and DNA through electrostatic interaction [4,7]. The objectives of the present
review are to investigate the current status of fuel cells
and advances in utilization of chitosan biopolymer for
polymer electrolyte membrane technologies.

chemical energy obtained from a redox reaction directly
into electrical energy [5]. These cells consist of an electrolyte material that is packed between two thin electrodes
(porous anode and cathode). The input fuel passes over
the anode and oxygen passes over the cathode where they
are dissociated catalytically into ions and electrons. The
electrons pass through an external electrical circuit to
provide power while the ions move through the electrolyte
toward the oppositely charged electrode [2,4].
Fuel cells classification and engineering

Fuel cells are generally characterized by the type of
electrolyte material. These cells are mainly consisted
of: Alkaline Fuel Cell (AFC), Molten Carbonate Fuel
Cell (MCFC), Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell (PAFC), Proton
Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC), Solid Oxide Fuel
Cell (SOFC), and Biofuel Cell [9,10]. Figure 1, compares
and illustrates the prominent features of these cells [4].
In the all mentioned fuel cells hydrogen has an important
role in anode and these fuel cells are known as H2 fuels.
While, in non-H2 fuel cells including Direct-ethanol fuel
cells (DEFCs), Direct-methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), Reformed Methanol Fuel Cell (RMFC) and Direct-formic acid
fuel cells (DFAFCs) other chemical compounds such as
ethanol, methanol and formic acid act as electron donor in
anode [11,12]. Fuel cells offer many advantages such as
high efficiency, high energy density, quiet operation, and
environmental friendliness [4]. Following parts aim to
describe some of fuel cell types in more details.
Alkaline fuel cell (AFC)

AFCs are the first and the only type of cells to have reached
successful routine applications mainly in space explorations
such as space shuttle mission in the United States [2].
As illustrated in Figure 2, AFCs use liquid electrolyte
solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH) due to its high
alkaline hydroxide conductibility [9]. The AFCs generate

electricity from hydrogen in which hydroxyl ion (OH−)
from potassium hydroxide migrates from the cathode
to the anode. At the anode, hydrogen gas reacts with
the OH− ions to produce water and release electrons
[11,12]. The overall reactions are given as below:

O2 þ 2H2 O þ 4e− → 4OH−

Overall cell reaction:
2H2 þ O2 → 2H2 O þ electrical energy þ heat
AFCs offer some advantages over other fuel cells, mainly
relatively low operating temperature. High-temperature
AFCs operate at temperatures between 100°C and 250°C.
However, newer AFC designs operate at much lower temperatures ranging from 23°C to 70°C. Another advantage
is that higher reaction kinetics at the electrodes results in
higher cell voltages. This high electrical efficiency permits
the use of lower quantities of a noble expensive metal
catalyst like platinum [9]. AFCs produce potable water in
addition to electricity. Therefore, they have been a logical
choice for spacecrafts. Most of the AFCs have been
designed for transport applications [13]. One of the major
drawbacks of the AFCs is that alkaline cells need very pure
fuels [9]. It is related to the use of the liquid electrolyte
[14,15]. The KOH solution is very sensitive to the presence of CO2. When air is used instead of oxygen, the hydroxyl ions may react with CO2 contained in the air and
an unwanted chemical reaction forms a solid K2CO3
that interferes with the other chemical reactions inside
the cell [14,16,17]. Another disadvantage is related to
the amount of liquid electrolyte. If the liquid is higher
or below the required level, it can lead to electrode
flooding or electrode drying [9].

carbonate ions (CO23 ) from the cathode to the anode [18].
At the anode, hydrogen oxidation reaction combines with
carbonate ions producing water and carbon dioxide and
releasing electrons to the external circuit. At the cathode,
oxygen is reduced to carbonate ions by combining with
carbon dioxide and electrons from the external circuit,
therefore, electrochemical reactions are as below [2]:

Molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC)

As shown in Figure 3, MCFCs are high-temperature fuel
cells that use an electrolyte composed of a molten carbonate salt mixture (salt of sodium or magnesium carbonate)
suspended in a porous, chemically inert ceramic lithium
aluminum oxide (LiAlO2) matrix. In MCFCs the electrolytes are heated to 650°C, and the salts melt and conduct

The high operating temperature of these cells limits damage from the carbon monoxide poisoning of the cells and
waste heat can also be recycled to make additional electricity [19,20]. The primary disadvantage of current MCFC
technology is durability. High operating temperatures and
the use of corrosive electrolytes accelerates component
breakdown and cell life. Scientists are currently exploring
corrosion-resistant materials for components as well as fuel
cell designs that can increase cell life without decreasing
their performance [2].
Phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC)

PAFCs are considered as the first generation of modern
fuel cells. They are the most mature cell types and the
first used commercially. Unlike the AFCs which were
primarily developed for space applications, the PAFCs
were targeted initially for terrestrial commercial applications with CO2 containing air as the oxidant gas and hydrocarbons (natural gas in particular) as the primary fuel
for power generation. As the name implies, the PAFCs
use the phosphoric acid (H3PO4) in highly concentrated
form (>95%) as its electrolyte and porous carbon electrodes
containing platinum catalyst which significantly increases
the cost of the cell [2,21]. Internal parts of PAFCs must be
able to withstand the corrosive acids [22]. The electrolyte is
often immobilized in a porous silicon carbid (SiC) matrix
by capillary action. Pure hydrogen or hydrogen–rich gases
can be used as fuel and air is almost invariably used as oxidant. PAFCs normally operate at temperatures between
170°C to 210°C. Because the acid electrolyte is tolerant to
the presence of CO2 in the reactant gas streams, hydrogen
produced by steam reforming of organic fuels, such as hydrocarbons (typically natural gas or methane) and alcohols
(mainly methanol or ethanol) are often used as the anodic
reactant (Figure 4) [2]. These cells are more efficient (80%)
when used for the co-generation of electricity and heat
as compared to generating electricity alone (40–50%)
[22,23]. Moreover, PAFCs can tolerate a carbon monoxide concentration of about 1.5%, which broadens the
choice of their use [22].

In direct methanol fuel cells, the solution of methanol
and water is fed to the anode where it is internally reformed
by the catalyst and oxidized to liberate electrons and
protons. The cathode reaction for DMFC is similar to a
hydrogen fuel cell [25]. The overall reactions for this
type of cells are given as below:

3=2O2 þ 6H þ 6e− → 3H2 O
CH3 OH þ 3=2 O2 → CO2 þ 2H2 O

Compared to hydrogen fuel cells, DMFC is further
advantageous for its ease of fuel delivery, storage, operation at low temperature and lack of humidification requirements, as well as its reduced design complexity and
high power density [26]. Despite these advantages limited
operating temperatures, susceptibility to osmotic swelling,
methanol crossover and high costs are among the factors
hindering the commercialization of DMFC [27].
Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)

Figure 4 Schematic representation of a phosphoric acid fuel
cell (PAFC) [2].

Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC)

Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) also known
as Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells are
consisted of a proton conducting cast in solid polymer
form. Electrodes are porous carbon containing a platinum
or ruthenium catalyst. PEMFCs deliver high-power density
and offer the advantages of low weight and volume, no free
corrosive liquid and hence longer cell lifetime compared to
other fuel cells [2]. Schematic representation of a PEMFC is
shown in Figure 5. There are two types of proton exchange
membrane fuel cells, namely: hydrogen fuel cells and direct
methanol fuel cells (DMFC), both of which utilize proton
exchange membrane to transfer protons [13]. In hydrogen
fuel cells at the anode, hydrogen is oxidized to liberate two
electrons and two protons [24]. The protons are conducted
from the catalyst layer through the proton exchange
membrane and the electrons travel through the electronic
circuits. At the cathode, oxygen is reduced to water. The
overall reactions are given by:
Anode
Cathode
Overall

H2 → 2Hþ þ 2e−
1=2O2 þ 2Hþ þ 2e− → H2 O
H2 þ 1=2 O2 → H2 O

Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are best suited for large-scale
stationary power generators that are able to provide electricity for factories and towns [11,28]. SOFCs, as shown in
Figure 6, mainly use a hard ceramic compound of metal,
such as calcium oxide or zirconium oxide as the electrolyte
[29]. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be used as the
reactive fuels in SOFCs [30]. SOFCs are expected to be
around 50%–60% efficient at converting fuel to electricity.
In applications designed to capture and utilize the system’s
waste heat (co-generation), overall fuel use efficiencies
could be up to 80–85%. Solid oxide fuel cells operate at
very high temperatures of 1000°C. The oxygen is supplied,
usually from air at the cathode. At these high temperatures,
oxygen ions (with a negative charge) migrate through the
crystal lattice. When a fuel gas containing hydrogen passes
over the anode, a flow of negatively charged oxygen ions
move across the electrolyte to oxidize the fuel [31]. When
hydrogen is used as the fuel the reactions c [30]:

And when carbon monoxide is the fuel the reactions are:
Anode
CO þ O2− → CO2 þ 2e−
Cathode 1=2 O2 þ 2e− → O2−
Overall CO þ 1=2 O2 → CO2
High-temperature operation removes the need for
precious-metal catalyst, thereby reducing the cost.
However, the high temperature limits applications of
SOFCs units and they tend to be rather large, while
solid electrolytes cannot leak, they can crack [32].

Biofuel cell

Microorganisms are able to convert enormous amounts
of energy from an incomparable range of chemical substrates [33]. Biofuel cells are a subset of fuel cells that
employ biocatalysts such as a microbe, enzyme or even

organelle interacting with an electrode surface [34,35]. The
main types of biofuel cells are defined by the type of biocatalyst. Microbial fuel cells employ living cells to catalyze the
oxidation of the fuel, whereas enzymatic fuel cells use enzymes for this purpose [36]. These types of catalysts offer
great benefits in catalytic activity, specificity and cost. However, development and full evaluation of these dynamic and
often sensitive bioelectrochemical systems require a diverse
range of expertise [33]. Biofuel cells like other ones require
porous anode and cathode structures that support fuel
transport to the catalyst reaction sites [36]. Either a
polymer electrolyte membrane or a salt bridge can separate the electrodes. The two main application areas
that are being considered for enzymatic biofuel cells are
in vivo, implantable power supplies for sensors and
pacemakers and ex-vivo power supplies for small portable power devices (wireless sensor networks, portable
electronics, etc.) [33].
Enzymatic fuel cell (EFC)

Figure 6 Schematic representation of a solid oxide fuel cell
(SOFC) [2].

Enzymatic fuel cells (EFCs) which replace expensive metal
catalysts with cheap enzymes are still in an early stage of
their development [33]. A conventional EFC is shown in
Figure 7. Enzymes have the advantage of specificity which
can eliminate the use of a membrane separator. EFCs typically possess orders of magnitude higher power densities
(although still lower than conventional fuel cells), but have
limited lifetime (typically 7–10 days) due to the fragile
nature of the enzyme and have low efficiency as only a
single type of enzyme is employed and can only partially

Microbial fuel cell (MFC)

Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) employ living cells [36].
MFCs are obtained when catalyst layer used into classical
fuel cells (polymer electrolyte fuel cell) is replaced with
electrogenic bacteria [43]. Figure 8 represents a schematic
of MFCs. As clearly observed in this figure, the substances
(organics represented as chemical oxygen demand) are oxidized to CO2 by microorganisms, which transfer the gained
electrons to the anode. At the cathode, the electrons are
used to reduce oxygen abiotically or biotically to produce
water. To maintain electro neutrality within the system,
positive charges have to migrate from the anode to the
cathode through an ion-permeable separator (for example a cation exchange membrane) [44]. The current
advantages of MFCs are that they have long lifetimes
(up to five years) and are capable of completely oxidizing simple sugars to carbon dioxide [45-47]. However,
they deliver low power densities owing to slow transport
across cellular membranes [48]. MFCs are a promising
technology for efficient wastewater treatment and generating energy as direct electricity for onsite remote application [43].

oxidize the fuel [37,38]. This is in contrast to living cells
that multistep enzymatic cycles (i.e. Kreb’s cycle) and
pathways (i.e. glycolysis) can completely oxidize biofuels
(e.g. ethanol, lactate and glucose) to carbon dioxide and
water [36]. There are a number of strategies for solving
these problems. Firstly, in terms of maximizing power
density biofuel cell, anodes should poss multidimensional
and multidirectional pore structures [39]. They should be
able to optimize the need for surface area. Secondly,
the successful immobilization of multienzyme systems
that can completely oxidize the fuel to carbon dioxide
is needed [40,41]. Finally, the anode must support efficient charge transfer mechanisms whether it is direct
or mediated and balance electron transfer with proton
transfer [36]. Several enzymes such as glucose oxidase,
alcohol dehydrogenase, formate dehydrogenase, lactic
dehydrogenase, glucose dehydrogenase and formaldehyde
dehydrogenase were successfully immobilized and used in
EFCs to date [42].

Interest in some kinds of fuel cell technologies dropped
owing to economic factors, material problems, and certain
inadequacies in the operation of electrochemical devices
[49]. One of the main drawbacks of the fuel cells is related
to the use of the liquid electrolyte. Using a polymer membrane as an electrolyte can solve some limiting requirements of fuel cells. For instance the essentially need for
using pure fuels in AFCs have been overcome by using
a polymer membrane as an electrolyte [14,15]. Fuel cell
membranes must meet several desired properties such
as high proton conductivity, low electronic conductivity,

impermeability to fuel gas or liquid, good mechanical
toughness in both the dry and hydrated states, and
high oxidative and hydrolytic stability in the actual
fuel cell environment [4]. These properties are related
to properties such as ion exchange capacity, morphology and water uptake that must be assessed as
well when characterizing potential of a new fuel cell
membrane [9].
Recent development of proton exchange membranes

The first polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) used in a
fuel cell system was sulfonated polystyrene membrane. It
was developed by General Electric for NASA in the early
1960s, as on-board power source in the Apollo flight
space mission [50]. However, this material was found to
have several major weaknesses such as lack of stability
and limited power density [51]. Currently, most commercially available membranes for fuel cells are based
on perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) polymer membranes
(e.g., Nafion, Flemion and Acipex) [4].
Commercial PEMs have many advantages such as high
proton conductivities at moderate operating temperatures
and wide range of relative humidities as well as good
physical and chemical stabilities. There are, however,
several drawbacks which have limited PFSA’s application
including its high cost, high methanol permeability and
environmental incompatibility with other materials [27].
To overcome these obstacles, extensive efforts have been
made to develop alternative low-cost membranes as potential PEMs. Most current development strategies have
used modified PFSA polymers (partially fluorinated), acid
functionalized aromatic hydrocarbon-based polymers or a
number of sulfonated aromatic polymers and composite
membranes. Composite membrane incorporates inorganic
materials, acids or other polymers into a polymer matrix
[4]. The modification efforts of PFSA membrane have been
focused on minimizing the methanol crossover which is
particularly serious in the DMFC system. Aromatic fluorinated polymers have been emphasized not only due to the
high cost of PFSA but also other fuel cell associated characteristics such as high mechanical and thermal stability,
chemicals, acids and bases, good resistance to oxidation
and very interesting surface properties [52]. Most alternative polymer membranes are summarized in Table 1.

CO2. The conducting species is now in a fixed solid polymer, therefore, there will be some carbonates due to the
reaction of the OH– with CO2 but because there are no
mobile cations (K+), solid crystals of metal carbonate will
not be formed to block the gas diffusion electrodes. The
main idea behind employing an anion exchange membrane
(AEM) in an AFC is to improve the AFC’s efficiency and
life (slow down performance degradation with time) [9].
Important challenges for the preparation of an efficient
AEM are ionic conductivity and mechanical stability.
Table 2 offers an overview of the various polymeric materials that are or can be used in AFCs.
Chitosan biopolymer for fuel cell applications

Chitosan, as a natural polymer, is one of the promising
membrane materials and has been studied widely. As
shown in Figure 9, it is the N-deacetylated derivative of
chitin which is naturally abundant polysaccharide and
the supporting material of crustaceans, insects, etc.
Chitin is easily obtained from crabs or shrimp shells
and fungal mycelia. Chitosan is inert, hydrophilic and
is insoluble in water, alkali and organic solvents. Its
solubility in dilute organic acids allows for gel formation
in various configurations. Chitosan has been studied as
membrane material for ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis,
pervarporation, and lithium batteries [8]. The removal of
proteins in chitin by heat treatment causes its deacetylation
simultaneously. Free amine and hydroxyl functional groups
on the chitosan’s backbone enable various chemical modification of chitosan to tailor it for specific applications
such as polymer electrolyte membrane for the separation
of metal ions, amino acids and protein by adsorption,
ultrafiltration, electro-ultrafiltration, fuel cell application
and pervaporation [83]. Utilization of a chitosan biopolymer for fuel cell technologies is novel and challenging
where biological products are usually considered as waste,
non-hazardous, low cost and environmentally benign [84].
Chitosan-based membranes are easily formed and have
high hydrophilicity, good chemical and thermal stability
[4]. Chitosan, as a natural abundant biopolymer is receiving great interest as materials for both membrane
electrolyte and electrode in various fuel cells such as
polymer electrolyte-based fuel cell including alkaline
polymer electrolyte fuel cells, direct methanol fuel cells
and biofuel cells [5].

Recent development of anion exchange membranes

In the solid AFC, the Anion Exchange membrane (AEM)
is one of the core components. In order to improve fuel
cell performance, the membrane must possess certain
properties. The role of the membrane is carrier for ion
(ionic conductor) and a barrier for gas and electrons
(electronic insulator). The most important advantage of
using a solid anion exchange membrane instead of a liquid
electrolyte in AFCs is to eliminate the negative effects of

Membrane is the core component of PEMFCs. Considering
that polymer membrane electrolyte is the most expensive
component of a polymer electrolyte-based fuel cell, the use
of low-cost chitosan-based membrane might bring down
the cost of a fuel cell [5]. Chitosan-based membrane electrolyte is being studied as alternative candidate for polymer

electrolyte membrane application to possibly produce
economical fuel cells [5]. To achieve high efficiency,
membrane must possess as mentioned before some desirable properties [83]. Modification of chitosan such as
sulfonation, phosphorylation, quaternization, chemical
cross-linking makes it cost-effective polymer electrolyte
membrane with low methanol permeability and suitable
ion conductivity especially at high temperature [3].

Polystyrene (PS) was introduced to form an interpenetrating
network with quaternized chitosan. Polystyrene is more
hydrophobic than quaternized chitosan and has good
mechanical strength. It was found that introduction of PS
improves tensile strength, and yet reduces elongation.
The addition of PS enabled the quaternary ammonia-based
membranes to have a higher tolerance to bases. However,
the membranes with a higher PS exhibit lower ionic conductivity due to the PS are a nonionic conductor [91].

Chitosan membrane for AFCs

Recently, derivatives of chitosan were created to serve
as novel polyelectrolytes for AFCs. N-[(2-Hydroxy-3trimethylammonium) propyl] chitosan chloride was synthesized, followed by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde
[85]. Crosslinked quaternized-PVA has a low mechanical
strength; therefore, Xiong et al. blended this polymer with
chitosan to improve their performance [86]. The obtained
composite membranes have more compact structure and
good mechanical strength. Wan et al. examined the ionic
conductivity of different chitosan membranes, such as pure
chitosan membranes with different degree of deacetylation
and molecular weight, di-o-butyrylchitosan, epichlorohydrin or glutaraldehyde cross-linked chitosan and proposed
that they are suitable for use in alkaline fuel cells [87-90].

Chitosan membrane for DMFC

For application in a DMFC, polymer electrolyte membrane
needs to have a low methanol crossover. The commonly
used Nafion membrane has relatively high methanol permeability. Chitosan has been employed as a promising
polymeric matrix for DMFC application considering its low
cost, desirable alcohol barrier property and proton conductivity as well as adequate thermal stability after cross-linking
[26,92]. In its dry state, chitosan has a very low electrical
conductivity. The addition of salts leads to the formation
of complex between salts and chitosan matrix, and also
enhancement of its amorphous nature [93]. Plasticization
is able to increase the amorphous content and thus improves the conductivity of a solid polymer electrolyte

[94]. Cross-linking is proposed to reduce crystallinity
of chitosan membrane and simultaneously enhance the
ionic transport [95]. Chitosan is hydrophilic and consequently has a high degree of swelling. An excessively
high level of water uptake increases the fragility of the
membrane and makes it less durable in fuel cells.
To overcome the disadvantage of loss in mechanical
strength in the wet state, chitosan is blended with tough
polymers such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) [96]. Mat,
et al. fabricated a polymer electrolyte composite membrane that comprises of chitosan, PVA and calcium
oxide (CaO). These results indicate that chitosan-PVACaO composite membranes have excellent methanol
barrier properties which in turn make them feasible for
DMFC applications [3].

Current advances in application of chitosan biopolymer
as electrode in fuel cells

An electrode in a polymer electrolyte-based fuel cell
usually consists of supported or unsupported catalyst
with or without binder loaded on an electrode substrate or a gas diffusion layer. Polymeric materials are
often employed as binder to bond catalyst particles and
also provide ionic conduction [5]. Nafion material is
also used as electrode binder which facilitates ionic
conduction that provides mechanical support for catalyst
particles and enhances dispersion of catalyst particles
in the catalyst layer. Nafion possesses many desirable
properties as a polymer electrolyte, and yet it is very
expensive and loses ionic conductivity if not sufficiently hydrated [5]. The chitosan binder exhibited
better performance than a Nafion binder especially at
elevated cell temperatures, ascribed to the hydrophilic
nature and water retention characteristics of chitosan.
In addition, the amount of required chitosan binder
for making electrode is much less than that of Nafion
binder [97]. Klotzbach et al. modified chitosan with
butanal, hexanal, octanal or decanal aldehydes to prepare
a biocompatible and biodegradable hydrophobic chitosan
membrane that can replace Nafion for electrode coatings in both sensor and fuel cell applications [98,99].
Functionalization of carbon nanotube by chitosan introduces positively charged functional groups on the surface
of carbon nanotube which serves as a medium to stabilize
and anchor metal nanoparticles through electrostatic
self-assembly and also provides proton path for methanol
electrooxidation reactions [100]. Wang et al. reported that
chitosan/tungstophosphoric acid modified Pt/C catalyst
demonstrated higher utilization efficiency as compared to
pristine Pt/C catalyst [101].

Chitosan for biofuel cells

To develop a stable enzymatic biofuel cell, a matrix for
enzyme immobilization is critical to retain the activity of
enzyme in a long period [102]. Carboxyl and amine side
groups of chitosan can serve as protein-binding ligands
for enzyme immobilization [103-105]. Three-dimensional
electrodes possessing multidimensional and multidirectional pore structures are possible solution to improve
performance of a biofuel cell. Chitosan scaffold was used
to fabricate enzymatic electrode that oxidizes glucose and
produce electrical current more effectively than the same
electrode made of a chitosan film [106]. The large pore
size of chitosan scaffold enables it to support bacterial
colonization of internal pores without increasing flow
resistance [107]. It was reported that carbon nanotube/
chitosan nanocomposite bioelectrode enhanced the
electricity generation of microbial fuel cells [108-110].
Conclusion and perspective

Fuel cells are often regarded as one of the advanced energy
technologies for the future. However, commercialization of
fuel cells is still a subject of the ongoing research. The
development of PEMFC power system has been accelerated for vehicular and home-use applications. Pure
hydrogen fuel appears likely to be the appropriate
choice for vehicle applications. Although fuel cell technology has matured substantially over the past decades,
special attention has to be given to composite techniques
in developing electrolyte membrane since these techniques have proven their effectiveness. It is necessary
to develop alternative membranes that have high ionic
conductivity and have sufficient mechanical strength
and chemical stability to be made as thin as possible.
Recently, many efforts have been made in utilization of
chitosan with improved properties for being used as a
polymer electrolyte membrane and electrode in fuel
cells. These chitosan based membranes generally do
not offer significant advantages over traditional Nafion
membrane as far as proton conductivity is concerned
and as a result the corresponding power density of related
fuel cells is also lower than Nafion-based ones. The intrinsic
ionic conductivity of chitosan-based membrane, therefore,
needs to be further improved for fuel cell application.
The mechanical strength and shelf life of chitosan also
need further enhancements which have not been given
extensive attention to date. Efforts have been made to
improve properties of chitosan membrane, including
chemical modification such as sulfonation, phosphorylation,
quaternization and formation of chitosan composite. These
methods improve some properties of chitosan with or
without sacrificing the others. Application of chitosan
composite membranes has been proved to be effective
approach in reducing their cost as well as improving
their operating reliability.
