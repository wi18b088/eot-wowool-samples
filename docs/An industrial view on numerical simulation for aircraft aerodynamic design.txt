Abstract In Airbus view, one major objective for the aircraft industry is the reduction
of aircraft development lead-time and the provision of robust solutions with highly
improved quality. In that context it is important to exploit all opportunities provided
by enhanced or new classes of numerical simulation tools, e.g. high fidelity multidisciplinary Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and powerful High Performance
Computing (HPC) capabilities.
To help meet the challenge of superior product development it will finally be essential to numerically ‘flight-test’ a virtual aircraft with all its multi-disciplinary interactions in a computer environment and to compile all of the data required for the
development and certification with guaranteed accuracy in a reduced time frame. Numerical simulation is foreseen to provide a tremendous increase in aircraft design
efficiency and quality over the next decades. This concept is considered by Airbus as
one of the long term main objectives for aircraft development.
Progress in HPC will essentially contribute to achieve this goal. Considerable
changes of aircraft design processes and way of working will lead to significant reduction of development times while including more and more disciplines in the early
phases of design activities in order to find an overall optimum aircraft design.
Aerodynamic Design deals with the development of outer shapes of an aircraft,
optimizing for its performance, handling qualities and loads. A major ingredient to
the design process is the numerical simulation of the external airflow. The capabilities
to predict the flow not only near the design point but also under other challenging
conditions in a given flight envelope is a prerequisite for optimization towards market
requirements.

Since it began about 50 years ago, CFD has made important progress in terms of
accuracy of the physical models, robustness and efficiency of the nonlinear solution
algorithms and reliability of the overall prediction approach. This trend will continue
over the next decades. In our view, along with the increasing capability to model and
compute all major multi-disciplinary aspects of an aircraft, in the long term it will
become possible to ‘fly’ and investigate the complete aircraft in the computer.
Currently numerical simulation provides good means to analyse the flow around
the aircraft in detail, although the regime of flow separation onset up to maximum
lift conditions is still not modelled accurately enough, nonlinearities and turbulence
modelling for separated flows are still a major concern.
It was not only the increase in HPC power that made more sophisticated NavierStokes solving enter the daily industrial design process. Better understanding and
mathematical analysis of the system of Navier-Stokes equations led to more powerful
algorithms, to more capable software and more comprehensive analysis of aircraft
flows.
However, a lot work remains to be done. Next decade’s goal will be to better exploit more accurate and efficient numerical formulations, advanced turbulence models and to achieve a fully flexible and automatic CFD capability that works in a fully
adaptive manner, providing the best quality solution at minimum cost and time. This
will lead to a complete change in the way future aircraft will be designed.

1 Today’s CFD in aerodynamic design
Today, the aircraft industry has the experience, best practices and up to date capabilities to conduct a lot of numerical simulation in its daily design and development work
[1]. At the forefront, Aerodynamics is using a variety of CFD methods and tools,
which essentially help to analyse global as well as local flow behaviour about simplified and complex aircraft configurations. Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)
methods including 2-equation turbulence modeling is the most widespread approach
to tackle, with reasonable accuracy and best practices, even highly complex 3D takeoff and landing configurations. Aerodynamic design as well as aerodynamic modelling of the aircraft is highly supported by these means.
In a wider sense, simulation is also approaching multiple interacting disciplines.
Flexibility effects on aircraft aerodynamics and structural loads are in the direct scope
of CFD simulations coupled to CSM (Computational Structural Mechanics) models.
This area also extends to use flight control modules in order to simulate trimmed
aircraft configurations or even full flight manoeuvres. This approach, however, suffers
the same simulation drawbacks and requires very high computer resources.
The requirements on predictive capabilities have reached a level where full aircraft simulation is a must. Any judgement on design progress with respect to aircraft
performance, handling qualities or loads can no longer be based on geometrical, physical or aerodynamic simplifications. Instead all potential interactions between aircraft
components have to be taken into account. Previously favoured linear superposition
principles no longer yield the required accuracy and consistency of aerodynamic data.
It has become necessary to account for full nonlinear effects, requiring the study of

capability.

the aircraft globally, and not just as a sum of components. High fidelity RANS CFD
has made a big step forward to help solve this prediction task, although the simulation of nonlinear flows and related turbulence modelling are still a major problem for
accuracy and cost and considered as the main challenge for the future.
A further area where numerical simulation has already offered real benefit is design optimization. Although fast strategies to find the optimum for multi-disciplinary
multipoint design in 3D are still under development, the aircraft industry already uses
optimization algorithms for detailed design tasks. However, there is a need to further
explore available optimization techniques since they represent a significant potential
in enhancing design.
Figure 1 shows that CFD is used today on a wide variety of tasks in the aircraft development at Airbus. While essential external shape design activities are largely based
on CFD there is a more moderate use only on topics dealing with increased local geometric complexity, thus requiring considerably more effort in the future. Limited,
but growing, use of CFD can be found in areas that deal with highly complex geometries or need multi-disciplinary coupling, e.g. aero-thermics and aero-acoustics.
Some examples may illustrate what has been achieved in the industrial context.
1.1 Prediction of aerodynamic performance
The aircraft design process is relying on continuously growing knowledge about the
final product. Therefore detailed aerodynamic analysis is used to judge on progress
with respect to aerodynamic and overall aircraft performance. CFD plays an increasing role in this business because it can deliver aerodynamic quantities with acceptable

Page 4 of 14

accuracy, at least in the cruise speed regime. This finally allows the optimization of
the aircraft with respect to certain customer or market requirements like the typical
mission and payload.
The average flight efficiency is measured as the fuel needed for a certain trip divided by the distance. This ratio can be expressed through some major aircraft parameters:
TripFuel (SFC · Weight)
≈ 
.
Lift
Distance
Mach · Drag
SFC is the specific fuel consumption of the engine. The cruise Mach number and
the lift over drag ratio can be identified as aerodynamic contributions. Thus optimizing the fuel consumption aerodynamically means to design the aircraft for the highest
L/D at a given cruise Mach number. Compared to the first A300 our today’s aircraft
are about 46% more efficient.
A typical example of what CFD can deliver is in providing the local air pressure distributions. Near the preferred point of aircraft operation, i.e. the design cruise
Mach number and related cruise lift, the CFD results are very close to the experiment. Figure 2 shows a comparison of wing sectional pressure distributions between
wind tunnel results (dotted line) and two different CFD codes (elsA [2] and TAU [3,
4]). Although both codes use different computational meshes (block-structured vs.
hybrid-unstructured) there is hardly any difference between the two. Compared to
the experimental values the pressure peaks, gradients, overall pressure levels, flow
accelerations and decelerations are very well matched. Only the transonic shock position is not properly captured. However, the picture at the right shows that a major
reason for this deviation, beside turbulence model effects, is the influence of the wind
tunnel model support (sting). Including the sting in the simulation reduced the differences between wind tunnel and CFD results all over the wing. This effect was more
pronounced on the outer wing, as shown on wing section 4 of Figure 2.
1.2 Wind tunnel test support
Wind tunnel experiments continue to be a major means to provide aerodynamic information. However, all specific modelling effects like for example, model size and
simplification of geometrical details, wind tunnel walls and test support must be corrected in order to predict the free flight aircraft data. This correction process was
formerly based on a number of corrections which were applied in a kind of linear
summation. This follows the assumption that those effects are mainly independent
and thus can be superimposed with only minor error. Today this is no longer feasible as nonlinearity has to be taken into account. This means that for a sufficiently
accurate overall result more detailed local flow field corrections have to be applied.
Specifically concerning the model support effect via CFD it is now possible to quantify even the influence on local flow (Figures 2 and 3). Figure 3 [5] shows the local
pressure differences between a CFD calculation for the aircraft mounted on a strut
and the free aircraft. Obviously the strut has significant influence on the lower wing
pressure distribution and even on the upper wing near the inboard leading edge.

2 Main issues with numerical simulation
There are a number of recent publications that provide a good overview on what
numerical simulation has delivered to aircraft design and what challenges we are
going to face, e.g. [6]. Some aspects are highlighted in the following sections.
2.1 Aircraft models
Aircraft Design is based on principal models of flight, telling about the relations
between basic geometry and configuration parameters used to define the wing, e.g.,
wing area, span, taper, bending, twist etc., and aerodynamic performance, aircraft manoeuvre and controllability qualities, and loads on the structure due to aerodynamic
forces and moments. Such an aircraft, pre-defined according to the needs derived
from target missions, has to be given optimized external shapes. Geometrical modelling is necessary to allow the designer to construct and modify aircraft components
and shapes. Computer Aided Design (CAD) systems like the commercial CATIA
software [7] essentially help to perform respective designs work. They provide mathematical descriptions of surfaces and ensure certain quality in terms of smoothness,
curvature, and joints. All numerical simulation of the flow around the complete aircraft needs a watertight model with fitting components, properly prepared to enter the
mesh generation process of CFD. The management of shapes during a design process
and their assembly for a full aircraft are also tough tasks. We still lack automatic assembly due to imperfections of the CAD systems, non-conformal use of those tools
by the designers and too strict requirements of the follow-on numerical mesh generation process and tools. Figure 4 shows the pylon intersection part of a wing in

high lift configuration. Curved surfaces, 90 degree sharp corners, small gaps between
components, and the complex flow characteristics to be represented make automatic
grid generation a challenge and one of the subjects identified for further development.
This is specifically true because we request a certain mesh and cell quality in order
to diminish the numerical error being produced by the discretization process. It has
been shown that for a given number of degrees of freedom regular hexahedral cells
aligned with the principal flow provide the best results [8]. This explains the emphasis
onto meshing based on these principles. Mesh adaptation based on error estimation
and Chimera techniques are also considered as a way forward for improved mesh and
solution quality.
2.2 Physical models
Over a wide range of the flight envelope, i.e. the complete range of speed, longitudinal
and lateral on-flow angles, flight levels and configuration variations, the flow about
aircraft exhibits a smooth behaviour. It can be predicted pretty well using the Navier
Stokes equations [9] as basic physical model. However, physically relevant scales
of the flow range from the order of kilometres (downstream wake effects) down to
the order of microns (near wall turbulence) or even less. For a computational mesh
resolving these scales would mean a mesh size of 109 points, which results in a nonlinear system of 1010 equations. Such a system is unrealistic to be solved on today’s
industrial computers, at least not at acceptable time and cost. This is also true for the
semi-deterministic computations such as LES (Large Eddy Simulation) which on top
need quite a big number of time steps to converge to sufficiently accurate statistics of
turbulence. Therefore the smaller scale physical effects need to be modelled, e.g. by
so-called turbulence models.

Fig. 5 Flight envelope challenges on CFD. While CFD is widely developed for the cruise design regime
it still faces essential challenges towards the borders of the flight envelope.

The Navier-Stokes equations comprise of 5 differential or integral equations, arising from the conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy. The open element in
these equations is the so-called Reynolds stress tensor, which in 3 dimensions needs
to correlate 9 entities - the Reynolds stresses - to the flow variables. By assuming an
isotropic behaviour of the fluid medium we end up with 6 quantities for which we
seek additional equations. There are however no conservation relations known for a
direct closure of the resulting system. Therefore these quantities are modelled using
specific assumptions on the flow.
The development and calibration of such models depend on the flow phenomena that appear in the aircraft flight envelope. Figure 5 provides an overview of the
flow conditions and effects that specifically appear at the borders of the envelope.
Massively separated flows at high-lift low speed conditions, low local Mach number
flows (low compressibility flow weekly coupled with the mean flow), strong nonlinearity at buffet boundary and shock boundary layer interaction and finally unsteady
effects in separated flows are all situations where numerical simulation suffers low
accuracy and very high cost and time.
The effects of pressure, surface curvature and surface quality, viscosity and even
temperature on local flow behaviour have to be taken into account. Increasing demands on accuracy have necessitated a move from 2-equation models to more sophisticated Reynolds-Stress models (RSM). The objective is to correctly predict with
high accuracy all local flow phenomena for a wide range of flow parameters, mainly
Mach, flow incidence and Reynolds numbers. For the sake of consistency and generality in prediction it is highly important to avoid any hard switch between turbulence
models, depending on the flow conditions. The RSM model class seems to provide
the best results for the whole flow regime.

Fig. 6 Typical successive growth of separation region on aircraft. Starting at the trailing edge of the wing
separation increases with increasing angle of attack. Specifically the inboard region is prone to develop
larger areas that finally extend to major parts of the wing surface.

With these considerations at hand, the flow stability is looked at as a separate
phenomenon. So-called transition models have been developed to predict the location
of transition from laminar to turbulent flow. These models more or less deal with the
analysis of amplification factors of relevant modes natural to the flow. Once these
factors have reached a certain threshold this is marked as transition location and the
turbulence model can be activated.
A remaining difficulty is to predict the onset of flow separation. i.e. the location
where the flow starts to detach from the surface. This physical effect is not fully
understood up to now, however, designers need this information for reasons of safety,
comfort, and handling qualities of the aircraft. Unfortunately the onset of separation is
very sensitive to local properties of the surface (roughness, curvature, kinks, etc.) and
the general properties of the flow (Reynolds number, energy content of the boundary
layer, etc.). For the correct prediction of separated flow the turbulence model plays a
major role and currently best practices on how to predict separation onset using such
models is the preferred approach.
Even more important to aircraft design is the appearance of massive flow separation. As long as a flow separation is confined to a small area of the wing or tails
only, it might be controllable and the pilot can counteract. However, when separation
starts to cover large areas this normally drives the aircraft into a complete lift loss and
thus a catastrophic situation. Thus massive separation prediction is directly coupled
to the prediction of maximum lift properties of the aircraft, which is a limiting factor
in take-off and landing performance. This prediction depends on the ability of the
turbulence model to detect the local separation and to describe the extension of the
separation up to the massive breakdown of the flow. Figure 6 provides a typical pic-

Page 10 of 14

ture of such extension of separated flow areas on an aircraft model in the wind tunnel.
For this high lift configuration at low Mach number, the local extension grows with
increasing angle of attack.
2.3 Discretization and numerical approaches
CFD simulation in practical industrial application is mainly confined to maximum
2nd order approximations on computational meshes that are specifically dense in
those areas of the flow field where some specific features need to be resolved. However, as we are not sure on the appearance of such phenomena conservative approach
is employed with a high number of mesh points. But it is clear that this recipe does
not solve the problem. Future solutions will hopefully provide means to automatically adapt the mesh and even the discretization accuracy to the local error information. Through the formulation of a so-called adjoint problem it is possible to compute
gradient information by which the sensitivity of a quantity like lift, drag or moment
against movement or placing of mesh points can be determined [10–13].
Much progress has been achieved using modern iterative solution techniques. Effective preconditioning schemes are available in context with implicit and multi-grid
iterative algorithms for the nonlinear equation system. Numerical dissipation is also
more and more under control, thus minimising the artificial or numerical effects in
the CFD flow solutions. A next step will deal with mixed meshes, i.e. an integrated
combination of structured and unstructured mesh discretizations. The essential element of this so-called HyperFlex approach [14] is to preserve the typical structured
discretization accuracy in most of the flow field while allowing for the flexibility
provided by unstructured meshes. This will free the need of an overall structured
multi-block mesh for which there is no chance of full automation.
Further steps to come will be on higher order and fully mesh/order adaptive methods. However, a robust industrialized production code for complex applications based
on these new methods is not foreseen before 2020. Many of the above mentioned topics are still open for further development.
2.4 Flight envelope prediction
Figure 5 shows a diagram that depicts the speed/load area which is the typical extended area of aircraft operation, i.e., the flight envelope. ‘Flaps up’ stands for the
so-called cruise configuration, ‘Flaps down’ are for take-off or landing. The success
of aircraft is based on the fact that air flow behaves in a rather controllable manner throughout a wide range of flight conditions. However, towards the border of the
envelope some major changes happen, which need careful consideration. Two main
aspects can be observed: shocks appear if Mach number increases beyond a certain
geometry-dependent threshold, which makes the flow behaviour non-linear. Heavy
loading of the aircraft, i.e. large differences between the upper and lower surface
pressures, has a major effect on the boundary layer, which could separate from the
aircraft surface and thus radically lower the generated lift. While the transonic nonlinearities (e.g. shock waves) are quite well understood, in their physics and their
predictability, this is still not the case for flow separation (Figure 6).

field. For aircraft development it is essential to know the scales of unsteady effects.

Finally, aircraft design and data work requires a large amount of flow simulation
data. However, this does not just mean a repetition by simulation of what has been
done with the wind tunnel in the past. On the contrary, it is expected that new ways of
sorting and organizing simulation processes will save quite a number of those computations. Sophisticated technologies like Design of Experiments, Variable Fidelity
Methods, Reduced Order Methods and other techniques will be used to provide a
full map of data at a minimum number of high fidelity simulations. For these techniques, error estimators and error propagation control will enable provision of results
at guaranteed accuracy.
2.5 Flow is unsteady
Looking into nature of flow there is nothing steady. It is only the small scales or high
frequencies that are not really recognized by an aircraft and its passengers. This is a
lucky point for aircraft flight overall, however, the more we go into detail with our
analysis the more we detect that the non-deterministic unsteadiness of flow plays an
essential role (Figure 7). Small scales are becoming more and more relevant, specifically in context of simulation of turbulence. But also larger scale unsteadiness poses
a problem on numerical simulation. The numerical effort to solve the unsteady flow
equations with certain accuracy in space and time is at least one order of magnitude
higher than for the steady case.
Seeking for higher accuracy of a flow solution via subsequent mesh refinement
may lead us into the middle of the problem: Resolution of the flow down to very
small scales in boundary layers with a steady flow solver probably provokes a nonconverging iterative process, because the flow is inherently unsteady. Therefore new
approaches have to be taken to allow automatic switching to an unsteady simulation
if the steady solution does not converge. This is a topic for further investigation.

simulation capability on an A380 aircraft in high lift configuration. The picture shows the geometrical
deformation.

2.6 Multi-disciplinary interaction
Efficiency, reliability etc. of an aircraft is not only the result of a single discipline’s
work. Multiple interactions determine what the customer finally sees as the product
performance. With increasing mono-disciplinary simulation accuracy it has become
necessary now to also model and simulate all relevant interactions. A major link exists, for example, between the aircraft structure and aerodynamics. Structural deformation due to aerodynamic loads influences the aerodynamic efficiency. This circuit
has to be converged until an equilibrium state is achieved. Numerically speaking we
have to couple aerodynamic and structural simulation via a local feedback transmission scheme. This type of integrated process is more and more entering the routine
simulation for static deformation. An example of static deformation on a complex
configuration is depicted in Figure 8.
More specific is the simulation of aero-elastic effects, like limit cycle oscillations,
buffeting or flutter. Here people are interested in the time accurate behaviour of the
interacting mechanism which finally may lead to exceed the structural load limits
of the aircraft which could be potentially catastrophic. This technology is still under
development.
2.7 Management of uncertainties
Even if we were able to do an absolutely exact numerical simulation of aircraft flight
we will have to deal with problems: Weather conditions, air turbulence, payload distribution, fuel distribution, engine performance and other parameters may vary. In
order to manage these type of uncertainties we need to know about the sensitivity of
all of the aircraft coefficients to changing input parameters. This is quite a new mathematical challenge. Statistical and heuristic methods are being applied; however, the

Journal of Mathematics in Industry (2011) 1:10

numerical effort can hardly be acceptable. Therefore more efficient approaches have
to be developed that would allow a judgement on potential risks.

3 Conclusions
Flow simulation plays a major role in aerodynamic design and its predictive quality is crucially dependent upon both discretization techniques and the capabilities of
turbulence modelling over a broad range of configurations and flow situations up to
the borders of the flight envelope. Enhancing these capabilities, especially for critical regimes of unsteady and/or separated flows, is presently considered as one of the
main objectives in the field. This will directly impact the quality of aircraft design
and as a consequence in drag and weight reduction, which in turn lead to reduced
fuel consumption and CO2 emission. These are major objectives of the Green Aircraft Area.
With the clear tendency of the airframe industry to base their design cycles much
more upon numerical simulation and to perform experiments with a significantly reduced frequency at a later point in the development cycle, it is of utmost importance
to increase the reliability and the trust in numerical predictions.
It obvious that improved simulation capabilities will have a rather large impact
on improving cost efficiency both with respect to aircraft development cost and aircraft operational cost. With advanced numerical simulation tools becoming less errorprone, this will not only improve the flow simulation alone, but also influence coupled
computations, like design optimization, simulations of fluid-structure interaction or
multi-disciplinary optimization. The quality of flow simulation has an even stronger
impact in these fields where quantitative errors easily multiply. Thus the whole design
chain will become not only more competitive, but also more productive, contributing
to the reduction of the time-to-market of the products and to the reduction of aircraft
development costs, leading in turn to stable or even reduced travel charges.
Airbus - together with major research partners and companies in the field - is
working on the FuSim [15] initiative to develop Aerodynamics and Flight Physics
towards a new paradigm of simulation. This treats all aspects of simulation (physics,
turbulence modelling, mathematics, algorithms, hardware, software, computer science, information technology, man-machine interface, overall system, data handling,
applications, etc.) which deliver essential contributions and provide their input and
support to the superior cooperative effort. Enormous effort is needed to develop the
simulation capabilities to the level required to be fully deployed for aircraft design.
Major centres of expertise in numerical simulation in several countries are working
together on this initiative with emphasis on specific aspects of simulation technology
and application.
In this paper we have not tackled the extension to numerical optimization. This is
another field of mathematical activities where we are looking for fast and comprehensive search algorithms for local and global optima of a variety of cost functions.
This is a wider topic that will receive our attention in the coming decade.
