Introduction
Nanocomposites are the materials of twenty-first century
having an annual growth rate of 25% due to their multifunctional capabilities. With unique design possibilities
and properties, they attract the attention of researchers
worldwide. Due to the possibility of combining desired
properties, nanocomposites are expanding their potentials
in aerospace applications and in future space missions.
Selection of the constituents of nanocomposites (matrix
and nanofillers) leads to the improvement of certain desired
properties. For aerospace applications, mechanical, thermal, electrical, chemical and biodegradable properties are
of interest. Chemical property like resistance or passiveness to corrosion is of prime importance. Apart from low
weight requirements, aerospace structures pose requirement of mechanical properties for design like strength,
toughness, fatigue life, impact resistance and scratch
resistance. Aircrafts flying at high altitudes require properties like low solar absorption, radiation resistance, high
thermal emissivity and electrical conductivity. Due to
increasing use of nanocomposites, handling their disposal
after the service life is of great concern. Thus, biodegradable property is also being preferred apart from their
functional properties (Gangopadhyay and De 2000; Ray
and Bousmina 2005; Pandey et al. 2005). Being environmentally friendly, few nanocomposites have opened the
possibilities of clean technologies (Choa et al. 2003).
Proper choice of nanofillers and matrix is a key in
achieving the desired multifunctional properties that are
required by many aerospace applications.
Nanofillers with low volume of 1–5% can enhance the
properties of composite materials that are comparable to
those of conventional microfillers with 15–40% volume.
Nanofillers have exceptional properties since they have

basic structure at crystal level that is defect free. Nanomaterials can be classified as per the dimensions
(Alexandre and Dubois 2000). Iso-dimensional (three-dimensional) nanoparticles have the three dimensions in
nanoscale like silica, metal particles and semiconductor
particles (Herron and Thorn 1998). Nanotubes or whiskers
are second kind of two-dimensional nanoparticles that have
two dimensions in nanometer scale (\100 nm) with the
third dimension forming an elongated structure (aspect
ratio more than 100) (Favier et al. 1997). Fillers like sheets
are one-dimensional with one dimension like the thickness
is in nanometer range (1 nm) and the other two dimensions
have an aspect ratio [25 (Ray and Okamoto 2003;
Alexandre and Dubois 2000). Each type of nanofiller has
its own advantages, disadvantages and unique properties.
Varieties of nanocomposites have been evolved
depending upon the type of matrix used for which they are
widely classified into three categories (as in case of
microcomposites) as polymer matrix nanocomposites
(PMNCs), ceramic matrix nanocomposites (CMNCs) and
metal matrix nanocomposites. PMNC and CMNC have
found applications for aircrafts and spacecrafts (see Fig. 1),
whereas the use of metal matrix nanocomposite is limited
due to the limitations of processing. Due to their ease of
production, PMNCs have been widely used (Alexandre and
Dubois 2000; Pandey et al. 2005; Thostenson et al. 2005;
Choi and Awaji 2005; Ray and Bousmina 2005; Andrews
and Weisenberger 2004). Disadvantages such as low
modulus and shear strength of polymer matrix have been

overcome by adding fibers, whiskers, platelets and carbon
nanotubes (CNTs). Several inorganic fillers increase
mechanical strength, impact strength, thermal stability and
flame retardancy, which are required for aerospace applications (Fischer 2003). Future space missions are being
planned which require large lightweight parts maintaining
properties for over 30 years in very harsh environments
involving exposure to atomic oxygen and solar radiation
(Thompson et al. 2003). PMNCs such as polymer/aluminum (polymer/Al) and polymer/alumina (polymer/
Al2O3) have improved ballistic performance (Meda et al.
2005) for which they have been used in preparing rocket
propellant. However, challenges arise when these properties of nanofillers have to be realized in nanocomposites.
This deficiency is due to poorly dispersed nanoparticles
and nanoparticle–matrix interaction (Andrews and
Weisenberger 2004; Nalwa 2000; Dresselhaus et al. 2001).
Depending upon the type of matrix used, functionalization
of nanofillers improves dispersion and interaction within
the matrix.
Ceramic matrix nanocomposites combine the properties
of ceramics like wear resistance, high thermal stability and
chemical stability with the properties of nanofillers (Sternitzke 1997; Choi and Awaji 2005; Peigney et al. 2000).
Nanofillers such as whiskers, fibers and platelets increase
the fracture toughness of the ceramics, mitigating their
brittleness (Becher 1991). In addition, these reinforcements
arrest the crack and prevent its propagation. Phase transition
and volume expansion in CMNC imparts toughening and

strengthening (Awaji et al. 2002). Nanocomposites like
alumina/silicon carbide (Al2O3/SiC) show increase in
fracture toughness arising from the crack-bridging mechanism of nanosized reinforcements (Ferroni et al. 2001).
Incorporation of nanofibers in ceramic matrix results in high
toughness with superior failure properties (She et al. 2000).
The discovery of CNTs (Iijima 1991) has led to the fabrication of multifunctional ceramic composites possessing
improved mechanical, thermal and electrical properties
(Biercuk et al. 2002; Ounaies et al. 2003; Weisenberger
et al. 2003; Cho et al. 2009). Applications of CNT-woven
fibers into textiles have added new scope in the area of
nanocomposites (Dalton et al. 2003). CNTs have typically
500 times more surface area based on equivalent volume of
a carbon fiber with high aspect ratio (Andrews and
Weisenberger 2004). A small number of defects per unit
length impart very high tensile strength, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity in the CMNCs.
Metal matrix nanocomposites consisting of metal matrix
with nanoreinforcements combine ductility and toughness
with high strength in shear and compression. These properties make them very much suitable for aerospace applications as structural materials (Tjong and Wang 2004).
However, metal matrix nanocomposites face several processing challenges for their migration into aerospace
applications. A chart in Fig. 1 shows the PMNCs and
CMNCs suitable for aerospace applications. Properties of
nanocomposites are controlled by adjusting the properties,
interaction with matrix, shape, arrangement and volume
fraction of nanofillers. Reinforcement size, morphology,
inter-reinforcement distance and the reinforcement–matrix
interaction control the performance and bulk properties of
the nanocomposite. Following the chart in Fig. 1, this
paper reviews the properties and potentials of PMNCs and
CMNCs in aerospace applications. Aerospace and space
industries are more diverse which include freight haulers,
military vehicles, satellites, spacecraft, space launch systems, microaerial vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles,
rotorcraft, ground-based systems etc. In the present paper,
we focus on the structural applications of nanocomposites
suitable for aerospace and space vehicles.

Polymer matrix nanocomposites
Polymers are macromolecules made up of the repeated
units (monomers) connected by covalent bonds. By the
dispersion of nanomaterials in polymers, the nanostructure
of polymers can be modified. The polymer holds the
reinforcement simultaneously retaining the properties of
polymer. Polymer nanocomposites are classified into three
categories depending upon the reinforcement type. These
are discontinuous reinforcement nanocomposites, layered

521

reinforcement nanocomposites and nanofiber or CNT-reinforced nanocomposites. The properties based on nanostructure and morphology of various PMNCs and their
corresponding aerospace applications are discussed next.
Structural applications
In some applications, apart from being lightweight, high
performance is of prime importance in aerospace structures
e.g., equipment enclosures, aircraft interiors, coatings,
cockpit, crew gear, heat shrinkage tubing, space durable
mirrors, housings, shrouds, nozzles and solar array substrates. Composite materials offer chemical stability and
fire resistance apart from the advantage of low operating
cost due to their lightweight. Three major drawbacks limit
the applicability of composites in most aerospace structures. Firstly, a higher electrical resistance leads to the
limitation for applications like electromagnetic shielding,
circuits, antennas and lightning strike protection (Peng
2011). Secondly, lower thermal conductivity of composites
increases the load on deicing systems based on electrical
heaters. Thirdly, composites are less resistant to impact and
suffer from moisture absorption, environmental degradation and aging with time (Mahieux 2006; Martin 2008).
Depending upon the matrix and filler used, many solutions
have been offered by nanocomposites to overcome these
limitations. Some of the nanocomposites and their aircraft
applications are discussed next.
Polyimide/clay
Clay or layered silicates (LS) are the nanofillers that
intercalate within the polymer to form layered nanocomposites. These are readily available at low cost and yield
predictable stiffening in the nanocomposites. The ability to
tune the surface chemistry via ion exchange reactions with
organic and inorganic cations yields strong bonding
between LS and polymer matrix. Due to the easy availability and well-known intercalation chemistry (Theng
1979), clays are widely used in PMNC (Alexandre and
Dubois 2000). Compared to microfiber composites, LSbased nanocomposites show improvements in moduli,
strength, heat resistance and biodegradability along with
decreased flammability and gas permeability. These
improvements make LS-based nanocomposites attractive
for aerospace applications (Bharadwaj 2001; Ray et al.
2002; Giannelis 1998). Polyimide/clay nanocomposite is
prepared by sol–gel process that involves embedding
monomers and organic molecules on sol–gel matrices.
Chemical bonds formed by the introduction of organic
groups lead to the formation of sol–gel matrix within the
polymer, simultaneously forming organic/inorganic networks (Avadhani and Chujo 1997).

Polyimide/clay nanocomposites show enhanced stress
and elongation at failure (Yano et al. 1997). Clay with
montmorillonite (MMT) exchanged by hexadecylammonium with loading up to 5 wt% increases the bulk properties. Above this loading, the properties degrade by
increasing brittleness. Increase in storage modulus is seen
at any temperature as shown in Fig. 2, for polyimide-based
nanocomposite filled with 2 wt% of organic clay. With
such an improvement, glass transition temperature also
decreases with increasing clay content. A greater
improvement in mica-based nanocomposite is seen due to
silicate layers with length of *218 nm and thickness of
*1 nm. Mica and MMT clays have exfoliated structures,
whereas aponite has a partially exfoliated–intercalated
structure and hectorite-based nanocomposite has intercalated morphology. Polymer/LS possess gas barrier properties due to tortuous (maze) path created by LS as shown
in Fig. 3 (Ray and Okamoto 2003, Bourbigot et al. 2000,
Yano et al. 1997). The tortuosity factor TF is related to
silicate length lS, silicate thickness WF and volume fraction
of the nanocomposites VF by

The relative permeability coefficient PR is the ratio of
permeability coefficient of composite and polymer matrix,
respectively. Relative permeability coefficient is found to
be inverse of tortuosity factor PR = 1/TF. Thus,
permeability coefficient is smaller if the length of silicate
is longer. Tortuosity effects the permeability of
nanocomposite PS by the relation

where PP is the permeability of the pure polymer. Bourbigot et al. (Bourbigot et al. 2000) have demonstrated

reduction in the permeability of gases like oxygen (O2),
water vapor (H2O), helium (He), carbon dioxide (CO2) and
ethyl acetate vapor in clay-based nanocomposites. A 2 wt%
clay loading decreases the water vapor permeability coefficient by 10-fold. Figure 4 shows permeability of polyimide nanocomposites obtained with different types of
fillers loaded by 2 wt% (Yano et al. 1997). Reduction in
permeability is higher in nanocomposites with fillers of
higher length. Fully exfoliated LS give the lowest permeability due to their creation of longer diffusive path. Owing
to these properties along with excellent abrasion and heat
resistance, polyimide/clay nanocomposites are used as step
assist in automobiles. In a similar way, polyimide/clay
nanocomposites are suitable for floor lining in the cargo
area of commercial airliners.
Epoxy/clay and epoxy/CNT
Processing of polymer/clay or polymer/CNT nanocomposites involves the dispersion of clay or CNT in epoxy
resin using ultrasonication followed by curing in molds to
form a structure. Ultrasonication continues for usually
30 min followed by curing for 24 h. Curing is carried out at
70 °C to avoid damage to the nanostructures (Dinca et al.
2012).
Mechanical testing done on epoxy nanocomposites with
clay or CNT fillers reveals an increased modulus of elasticity as shown in Table 1. Epoxy/CNT and epoxy/clay
show better thermo-mechanical properties as compared to
pristine matrix. COOH-functionalized epoxy/multiwalled
carbon nanotube (epoxy/MWCNT) has a tensile strength of
121.8 MPa, whereas pure epoxy has a tensile strength of
95 MPa. Increase in CNT concentration increases the
modulus of elasticity but decreases the tensile strength.
Addition of nanoparticles is limited to 2% since rheological
properties deteriorate above these levels.
Epoxy/clay can serve as attractive replacements for the
expensive talc powder and TiO2 to attenuate the permeability in fuel tanks (Stan et al. 2011, Luan et al. 2012).
Nanocomposites like fluoropoly(ether-amic acid)/montmorillonite (6F-PEAA/MMT) and polyethylene terephthalate/LS have also yielded significant improvement in
mechanical properties, impact strength, barrier properties
and flame properties (Vora and Vora 2006). These properties are highly desirable in providing safety to aerospace
structures in the event of fire and impact. Toyota used
polymer/clay nanocomposite for structural applications by
modifying natural clays (Giannelis 1996). Nanostructured
LS is a clay used to prevent gas diffusion through polymers. Thus, epoxy/clay nanocomposite is suitable for fabrication of extremely lightweight and strong cryogenic gas
storage tanks for aerospace applications. These

solvent (Vaia et al. 1993; Vaia and Giannelis 1997). The
LS is encased within liquid monomer to polymerize by the
action of heat, radiation, diffusion, catalyst and exchange
of cations between the layers (Usuki et al. 1993; Messersmith and Giannelis 1994). 2:1 phylosilicates is commonly
used which has layer thickness of 1 nm made up of a sheet
of alumina sandwiched between two silica sheets. Weak
van der Waals interactions hold the layers together. Small
molecules can be intercalated between these layers easily
(Azeez et al. 2013). Isomorphic substitution in the interface
produces negative charges counterbalanced by the alkaline
cations. Cations also provide functional groups that can
react with polymer matrix increasing the strength of the
formed interface (Krishnamoorti et al. 1996). Montmorillonite (Mx(Al4-xMgx)Si8O20(OH)4) (MMT), hectorite
(Mx(Mg6-xLix)Si8O20(OH)4) and saponite (MxMg6(Si8-xAlx)O20(OH)4) are the examples of commonly used LS,
where hydrated cations are ion-exchanged with bulkier
organic cations (Ray and Okamoto 2003). Montmorillonite
imparts remarkable changes in thermal and mechanical
properties of the nanocomposite. Incorporation of 4.1 wt%
MMT in Nylon-6 matrix results in 102.7% increase in
Young’s modulus (Kojima et al. 1993). Figure 5 shows the
variation of Young’s modulus with clay content of an
organo-modified nanocomposite (Kojima et al. 1993).
Nylon-6/LS are used in timing belt cover of automotive
engines (Bogue 2011). These nanocomposites additionally

nanocomposites are also flame resistant (Gilman et al.

environments.

Nylon-6/LS like nylon-6/MMT is prepared by a process of

erties of clay-based nanocomposites. The reason was
attributed to the small size of POSS that restricts the
mobility of surrounding polymer chain and good interfacial
adhesion. Flame-retardant tests showed enhancement in
flame-retardant properties due to the protection of underlying matrix by char formation on surface and the low
surface energy associated with the Si–O–Si present in
POSS (Ni et al. 2004). Water absorption drastically reduces
due to hydrophobic and partially ionic nature of Si–O–Si
link (Haque et al. 2003). These exceptional mechanical,
thermal, flame-retardant and water-barrier properties
makes the polymer/POSS nanocomposite suitable for highperformance aerospace structures.

possess an ablative property (Vaia et al. 1999) with which
they have the potential for their use in aerospace engine
components, body panels and crash guards.
Epoxy/DOPO-based phosphorus tetraglycidyl
High-performance materials possessing superior thermal
and mechanical properties have seen rapid developments
for aerospace applications involving adverse operating
conditions. Epoxy resins have excellent properties like
toughness, adhesion and chemical resistance. However,
epoxy does not possess thermal and mechanical properties
required by the aerospace structures. Phosphorus containing flame-retardant compounds like triphenyl phosphate
requires high loading to achieve the desired flame retardation. Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS)
reagents have appeared as alternative materials, which can
be incorporated easily in a polymer matrix like acrylics,
styryls, epoxy and polyethylene.
A
high-performance
10-dihydro-9-xa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide (DOPO)-based phosphorus
tetraglycidyl epoxy nanocomposite has been proposed by
Meenakshi et al. (Meenakshi et al. 2011) for aerospace
structural applications due to its good mechanical, thermal,
flame-retardant and water absorption properties. The
nanoreinforcement POSS amine was mixed with the epoxy
resin followed by curing process. The mechanical properties of such cured nanocomposites with resin types containing nanoclay and POSS amine as nanofillers are
compared in Table 2. Bis (3-aminophenyl) phenylphosphine oxide (BAPPO) and diaminodiphenylmethane
(DDM) were the curing agents used. The mechanical
properties of the nanocomposites with POSS showed better
mechanical properties even when compared to the prop-

Aerospace coating applications
Aerospace structures are subjected to diverse environments that include variations in moisture and temperature. They are also subjected to the contact with jet fuel,
deicing fluid and hydraulic fluid. The coatings should
withstand lightning strikes, ultraviolet exposure and
erosion from dust flowing at 500 mph. An aerospace
coating typically has a primer and a topcoat. The primer
provides the substrate with adhesion and protection from
corrosion. The topcoat is required to have matte finish,
flexibility, durability, chemical resistance, corrosion
protection and stable color for good appearance
(Blackford 1998). These requirements are classified as
shown in Fig. 6. The conventional ways to meet such
requirements are explained in brief next.
Lightening protection and electromagnetic shielding:
Lightning strike can cause direct effects, indirect effects
and damages in an aircraft. Direct effects and damages can
be caused from heat (*30,000 °C), acoustic shock waves
(500 psi impact force) and electrical charge (*200,000 A
current) (Rupke 2002). Indirect effect may cause damage
or interruption of electronic equipment. Heat is generated
by resistive or joule heating that causes most damage likely
by the breakdown of matrix in composite. To prevent
localized damage, thin metal mesh is embedded in outer
layers of composite (Gagne and Therriault 2014). This also
serves as a shield for electrical systems. Nonconductive
composites are given protection by strips on exterior surface to intercept lightning allowing the transparency to
electromagnetic waves emitted from the antennas (through
composites panels of antenna fairings). When radio frequency transparency is not required, conductive material is
applied over exterior surface. To improve electromagnetic
interference (EMI) and lightning strike resistance, conductive resins and single-walled carbon nanotube Buckypaper materials were introduced in composite materials

(Wang et al. 2005a; Gonnet et al. 2006; Park et al. 2009).
These Bucky-paper materials consisted of highly loaded
and magnetically aligned CNTs whose conductivity changed linearly with temperature.
Erosion: Erosion due to sand particles is higher at
oblique incidence due to scrubbing, microcutting action
and chip formation in ductile metal and polymers and due
to cracking and brittle fracture in ceramics and brittle
polymers (Lancaster 1990; Baikoula and Kirger-Kocsis
2002). Rain droplets cause impact induced debonding of
coating from the surface causing fatigue and tearing
(Lesser 1995). Rime and clear glaze of mixed ice (Armitage et al. 2004) can be rougher than a coarse sand paper
during their peeling off from the aircraft skin causing
erosion. Nickel, titanium shields, pure PU, blend of PU or
polyethylene coatings are used conventionally for protection from erosion (Van Krevelen 1990).
Deicing and anti-icing: Deicing and anti-icing performed on aircrafts help to remove and prevent the formation of ice. A thermally insulating coating reduces the
efficiency of deicing process carried out by electrical
heaters. In addition, retaining of heat within the insulation
degrades the composite structures (Peng 2011). Electric
matrix, CNT paper-resist heaters and transparent MWNT

films have been developed for deicing (Yoon et al. 2007).
Whereas, to reduce ice adhesion, ice-phobic coatings like
Rain-X and MP55 poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) coatings have been developed (Ferrick et al. 2006).
Radiation and corrosion protection: Ultraviolet rays,
humidity, heat and gas present in atmosphere cause
corrosion. Galvanic corrosion also results from composite (anodic) and metal combinations (cathodic).
Since corrosion is a primary mode of failure in aircrafts, coating is designed to provide corrosion protection. Coatings with low permeability for liquids give
barrier protection. Inhibitive pigments added in the
coatings impart electrochemical property and passive
protection to provide sacrificial protection (Sorensen
et al. 2009).
To achieve these requirements, two-component PU
systems have been used (Bierwagen and Tallman 2001).
Current aircraft coatings have limited life and capabilities.
Polymer nanocomposites provide the flexibility to tune for
mechanical, chemical, electrical, thermal, optical properties and their selective combinations for the aerospace
coatings (Baer et al. 2003). Development of novel coatings
to address the challenges of lightning, icing, erosion and
corrosion is a focused area of research at present.

Following subsections present the nanocomposite coatings
and their specific aerospace applications.
Conductive polymer/CNT for EMI shielding
Nanocomposite coatings embedded with fillers of various
functionalities suit for the topcoat of the aircrafts satisfying
its multiple requirements. Polyurethane elastomers possess
high wear resistance, corrosion resistance, elasticity and
adhesive property (Howarth 2003; Chattopadhyay and Raju
2007). Fillers like clay, alumina, CNT and nanodiamond
serve as main ingredients in the development of aerospace
coatings (Peng 2011). Spray painting is a technique adapted for aircraft painting. Adding fillers increases the viscosity causing difficulty in spray painting along with
inadequate wetting of nanoparticles and additives. Alternatively, electrospinning method is used to fire a jet of
solution through capillary tube on the surface (Lyons and
Ko 2005). The possibility of adding nanofibers and CNT in
the solution can produce coatings with good flexibility,
strength and area-to-volume ratio. The fabricated coatings
for aerospace applications differ in composition depending
upon the structural location and its corresponding functional requirements.
Conductive filler like SWNT as low as 0.5 wt% is sufficient to impart electrical conductivity for electrostatic
dissipation and EMI shielding. Variation of electrical
resistivity with SWNT content (wt%) in a polycarbonate
(PC) matrix is shown in Fig. 7 (Ramasubramaniam and
Chen 2003). A drop of resistivity from 1013 to 108 is seen
by an addition of 0.5 wt% MWNTs. For an addition of 5

percolation threshold) (reproduced from (Ramasubramaniam and

123

wt% MWNT, the resistivity further reduces to 106. Resistivity at 0.5 wt% loading is sufficient to achieve the electrostatic discharge requirements (Xia and Song 2006). Such
low loading of filler does not alter other physical properties
of the coating. Aircrafts that are heavily equipped with
electronic systems can seek protection from high-intensity
radiated fields by sources in air or on land or sea (Peng
2011) by employing PC/SWNT nanocomposite coatings.
In addition, the surface conductivity of PC/SWNT
nanocomposite coatings also enhances the lightning strike
protection.
Conductive epoxy/CNT heaters for deicing
Ice accretion occurs on an aircraft flying between 3000 and
5000 ft, consequently increasing the weight and drag. Ice
accumulation significantly alters the stall speed, which is
risky (Gent et al. 2000; Zeppetelli and Habashi 2012). To
mitigate ice accumulation, ice protection systems (IPS) in
aircrafts use the air bleed from engines, which are not
economical. Electromechanical deicing using ultrasonic
exciters and electromagnets causes aircraft skin fatigue and
noise. Electric heaters are widely used to prevent icing with
greater efficiency. These solutions available today have
limitations of weight, power, maintenance and integration
within the structure. Thin-film nanocomposite heating
element (0.038 mm) has been developed which is strong
and flexible (Buschhorn et al. 2013, Brampton et al. 2014).
These heaters have negligible weight, consume low power,
are maintenance free and can be easily integrated within
the structure. The heater patch consisted of *100 lm tall
CNT arrays synthesized by a thermal catalytic chemical
vapor deposition process (Bradford et al. 2010). The CNT
array was densified to a film by pushing them in one
direction using a steel tool of small radius. The film and its
morphology are shown in Fig. 8. The films were integrated
on a bistable composite laminate and on an aero-surface
substrate using for testing. The dominant charge transport
mechanism in such films is tunneling, which causes heating
(Li et al. 2007).
The voltage was applied across the heater on a
bistable laminate, and the current was measured across it.
A linear relation between voltage and current was seen
above 0.1 A, where the resistance stayed constant. At 0.63
A and 5 V, the bistable laminate snapped due to the rise in
temperature. However, due to heating, the resistance did
not change indicating the thermal stability of the
nanocomposite heater. The snapping of the laminate causes
the curvature to change rapidly causing the ice to shear off
from the surface especially during a cold start. The heating
and snapping of the wing surface ensure the freedom from
ice buildup. The power PH required by thin-film heater
drawing current IH is inversely proportional to thickness as

where RH, LH, wH, and hH are the resistivity, length, width
and thickness of the element. High electrical conductivity
and low thickness allow the heater to heat itself and the
substrate quickly. A linear relationship between power and
temperature (of the heater and laminate) was seen above
0.1 W of power. Thus, deicing temperature can be controlled by controlling the power of the nanocomposite
heater. Ice tunnel test was performed on wings with
nanocomposite heaters embedded on the skin (Buschhorn
et al. 2013). Harsh environment was created with temperature from 20.9 to -3.9 °C, with an airspeed of *55.9 m/s
and water content of 1.1 g/m3 with mean volume droplet
size of 30 lm. Nanocomposite heaters demonstrated successful deicing capability (see Fig. 9) as required by aircrafts flying through snow and storm.

Epoxy coatings are low-cost coatings exhibiting good
hardness, adhesion, chemical resistance and corrosion
resistance. Turri et al. (Turri et al. 2010) developed
nanostructured coatings made of epoxy/clay and epoxy/
alumina having additional properties like greater scratch
strength, thermal properties and barrier properties, fulfilling major requirements of aerospace coatings. Fabrication
of these coatings involves the mixing of resin and
nanoparticles at 40 °C for 30 min. Nano-Al2O3 (AluC) and
cloisite 30B, organophilic MMT clay (CL30B) fillers were
added to prepare two different types of nanocomposites.
Hardener was added to the mixture, and the resulting
mixture was bar coated on a glass substrate followed by
curing consecutively at ambient temperature, at 50 °C and
at 120 °C, for 2 h at each temperature level to get a coating
of 200–400 lm. Self-cross-linked hybrid coatings were
prepared by mixing 5% silica in a silanized epoxy. Silanized epoxy was prepared by blending diglycidyl ether of
bisphenol A and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane in 1:2 molar
ratio for 2 h in nitrogen atmosphere. This mixture was
added in a sol containing tetraethyl orthosilicate, water and
ethanol at a molar ratio of 1:3:4.5 and gently stirred.
Similarly, epoxy/Al2O3 coatings were also prepared.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) topography and
demodulation images were obtained to study the surface
roughness and scratch hardness. The surface topography
was obtained from the mean surface roughness and rootmean-square values. A demodulation phase image for the
hybrid epoxy/SiO2 nanocomposite is shown in Fig. 10. The
roughness was estimated from median surface level and
standard deviation within the image. The small domains

the image, and silica particles were fully embedded in the

Topographic images obtained after making a nanometric
scratch on epoxy/clay and on hybrid epoxy/SiO2 coating
are shown in Fig. 11a, b, respectively. A constant force of
FAFM = 3400 nN was applied on the AFM tip. Pileup was
observed at the scratch location from which the width of
the scratch was measured. Scratch hardness HS is given in
terms of normal load FAFM applied on the tip of AFM and

Standard tests like the Buchholtz indentation (for
indentation hardness) and Taber tests (for wear
resistance) were conducted. The indentation hardness

(evaluated from Eq. (4)) and wear resistance estimated
for various types of coatings are given in Table 3. Alumina
and clay-based nanocomposites showed improvement in
indentation and scratch hardness when compared to a
pristine epoxy. However, there was considerable increase
in surface mean roughness of epoxy/clay nanocomposite.
The wear index was improved in case of epoxy/alumina
and decreased in case of epoxy/clay. Thus, epoxy/alumina
coating is better than the epoxy/clay coating. The hybrid
epoxy/SiO2 coatings showed a remarkable improvement in
scratch hardness maintaining the surface roughness below
that of epoxy/clay coatings. Very high improvement in
scratch hardness of 1830, 942 and 700% was seen in hybrid
epoxy/SiO2 coatings when compared to pristine epoxy,
epoxy/alumina and epoxy/clay coatings, respectively.
Thus, hybrid epoxy/SiO2 coatings can be proposed as
coatings for aircrafts operating in dusty conditions,
sandstorms and hailstorms.

Superhydrophobic coatings have anti-sticking, anti-icing,
self-cleaning and anti-corrosion properties, which can
provide fluidic drag reduction and water corrosion prevention to the aerospace structures (Blossey 2003; Mishchenko et al. 2010; Hsu et al. 2013). Key parameters
governing hydrophobicity are the nanoroughness and surface energy. Wenzel model describes an increased surface
roughness leading to increased surface area imparting
hydrophobic nature (Wenzel 1936), whereas the Cassie–
Baxter model states that the air trapped within the grooves
causes hydrophobic behavior (Cassie and Baxter 1944).
Poly(vinilidene fluoride) PVDF is a strong polymer having
properties like abrasion resistance and corrosion resistance.
Addition of CNTs imparts additional properties to the
PVDF like hydrophobicity and conductivity (for EMI
shielding and lightning protection) making the PVDF/CNT
nanocomposites a suitable material for aerospace coatings.
PVDF/CNT nanocomposites coatings were prepared by
Chakradhar et al. (Chakradhar et al. 2014) using spray
coating method. PVDF and MWCNTs were dispersed in
dimethyl formamide (DMF) using a magnetic stirrer for
10 min, followed by ultrasonication for 50 min. The mixture was mixed with Milli Q water resulting in a precipitate. Precipitate was collected on a filter paper and dried.
The dried powder was dissolved with acetone by ultrasonication for 30 min. The mixture was sprayed on a glass
substrate to form 10–12 lm thick coatings.
Surface morphology of coating with 66 wt% MWCNT
examined by field electron scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM) is shown in Fig. 12a. Protrusion-like structures
were seen which cause enhanced surface roughness leading
to reduced wettability as per the Cassie–Baxter’s law. The

PVDF/MWCNT coatings exhibit superphobicity in contact
with the water (see Fig. 12b). The water contact angle
(WCA) and sliding angle (SA) were found to be 154° and
\3°, respectively (superhydrophobic), as compared to the
WCA of PVDF which is 105° (hydrophobic). The nanoroughness of the coating increased with the addition of
MWCNT causing superhydrophobicity. WCA measured at
different temperatures is shown in Fig. 13. For 20–30 wt%
coatings, the WCA gradually reduced reaching 10° at
623 K. The 33–66 wt% coatings showed considerable
stability up to 573 K. Thus, 33 wt% of MWCNT in the
PVDF imparted the necessary superhydrophobicity to the
coatings maintaining additional properties of the PVDF.
These properties make the PVDF/MWCNT coatings suitable for aerospace coatings for wet climates.
Aerospace tribology
Addition of lubricating and reinforcing fillers imparts tribological properties to the nanocomposites. Lubricating
microfillers like graphite, PTFE, molybdenum disulfide
(MoS2) decrease the friction of the sliding surfaces, but
their weaker bond in the material reduces the strength.
Reinforcing microfillers like glass and carbon fibers
increases the strength but also increases the abrasiveness.
Nanofillers overcome the drawbacks of these microreinforcements by the improvements in some characteristics of
the nanocomposites (Dasari et al. 2009). Nanofillers

coatings (reproduced from (Chakradhar et al. 2014), with the
permission from Elsevier)

increase the nucleation capability by improving interfacial
interaction with the polymer matrix. Rigidity of the matrix
is increased due to restricted mobility of the matrix
occurring near vicinity of the fillers. Nanofillers are more
effective than microfillers due to the increased surface area
of fillers (Wetzel et al. 2003) that creates huge polymer/filler interfacial area resulting in enhanced bonding
(Wetzel et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2002). In addition,

material removal during sliding is less since the size of
nanofiller and surrounding polymer chain is similar.
Apart from changing the physical and mechanical
properties,
nanofillers
change
the
crystallinity,
microstructure, glass transition temperature and degradation temperature (Friedrich 1993). Nanofillers influence the
transfer films, which is crucial in minimizing the wear rate
in bearings. Wear results from the rubbing bodies due to
friction, impact, thermal and other forces (Lim and Ashby
1987). Debris dislodge from the surface due to the loss of
cohesion causing wear mechanisms like abrasion, adhesion, erosion, delamination, corrosion and fatigue. These
mechanism involves softening, melting and pyrolysis
making wear phenomenon more complex to understand. A
widely accepted relation to estimate the wear volume loss
V (m3) is given by
V¼

kW NL
;
H

ð5Þ

where kW is the wear coefficient (mm3/N-m), N normal
load (N); l sliding distance (m); and H hardness of the
wearing material. An important factor governing wear is
the tribochemical reaction. Thus, Gibbs free energy
(DG) criterion facilitates the selection of fillers (Zhao and
Bahadur 1999). A negative DG indicates feasibility of a
chemical reaction that helps on the formation of tribofilm
reducing wear and favoring them for tribological
applications.
Shao et al. (Shao et al. 2004) found that the frictional
coefficient and wear rate decreased rapidly (Fig. 14) when
1 vol% nano-TiO2 particles were added to PPESK
copolymer. Nanocomposite was slided over a steel ring in
dry condition with velocity = 0.43 m/s, load = 200 N and
duration = 1.5 h. Micro-TiO2 particles had negligible
effect on friction coefficient and resulted in the increasing
wear rate with increasing filler content. A continuous thin
transfer film well bonded to the surface decreased the wear
rate. A thin Fe2O3 film was formed, and the elemental Ti
got attracted toward the steel surface bonding the formed
film to the surface. Compared to the transfer film of pure
PTFE (see scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in
Fig. 15), PTFE nanocomposites showed the smooth and
coherent transfer films (Shi et al. 2007). Increasing the
filler content increased the abrasiveness thereby increasing
the wear rate. Si3N4 also exhibited hydrodynamic lubrication behavior due to tribochemical wear when used in
thermoplastic or thermosetting polymer (Shi et al. 2003;
Wang et al. 1996). A formation of SiO2 in the tribofilm
reduced the friction and protected the sliding surfaces.
Table 4 lists the tribological properties of some
nanocomposites. The lowest wear rate was exhibited by
polyimide/CNT nanocomposite. These PMNCs are lightweight, have low friction and have low wear rate. In

addition, fillers like CNT impart thermal conductivity to
remove the heat built up during operation. Thus, PMNCs
are the preferred materials for the aerospace bearing
design.
Structural health monitoring applications
Structural health monitoring (SHM) systems increase the
reliability and safety of structures, which is mandatory for
many critical and high-performance structures of aircrafts.
SHM systems have reduced the cost involved by periodic
inspection, which happens to be around one-third of the
total cost in acquiring and operating the aircrafts (Diamanti
and Soutis 2010; Giurgiutiu and Soutis 2012). Piezoelectric
and piezoresistive nanocomposite sensors and actuators
have been developed recently that are easy to fabricate,
have low cost, making them suitable for the use in SHM
systems of large aircrafts and various measuring gauges.
Piezoelectric polymer matrix nanocomposites
Piezoelectric PZT wafers are the widely used transducer
elements in SHM (Rathod and Mahapatra 2010; Giridhara

Due to their toxic nature, brittleness and high cost,
piezopolymer transducers like PVDF and poly(vinylidene
fluoride–trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) have been
developed as alternatives (Rathod et al. 2010; Jain et al.
2013a; Jain et al. 2013b). To facilitate the processing,
piezoelectric PMNCs have been developed (Jain et al.
2014; Rathod et al. 2014). Nanocomposites also possess
structural and electrical properties that can be tailored by
controlling its composition to make them suitable for
transducer applications. Piezoelectric PMNC consists of
piezoelectric nanofillers like PZT, zinc oxide (ZnO)
embedded in a polymer matrix (Daben 1990; Jain et al.
2014; van den Ende et al. 2007; Meyers et al. 2013). These
nanofillers impart piezoelectricity simultaneously retaining
the properties of the polymer. Recently, PVDF and epoxy
polymers have received close attention as matrix material,
as discussed next.

PVDF/PZT films PVDF/PZT films exhibit piezoelectricity due to both PZT nanoparticles and the PVDF matrix. It
also possesses the properties of PVDF like low acoustic
impedance, strength, corrosion resistance, flexibility, nontoxic nature satisfying most of the requirements for aerospace sensor applications. Jain et al. (2014) have developed
piezoelectric PVDF-PZT nanocomposite film sensors using
a solvent cast method. A measured quantity of PVDF was
dissolved in DMF by stirring and heating in the microwave
oven until it dissolves. The PZT was dispersed thoroughly
in the polymer PVDF solution. The average grain size of
the PZT particles was in the range of 1 lm to 25 lm. The
prepared solution was then casted on the glass plate and
heated in an oven at about 65 °C. With the complete
evaporation of solvent, PVDF-PZT nanocomposite films
were obtained. The process was repeated with different
weight fractions (ranging from 10 to 50 wt%) and different
particle sizes of PZT. The prepared films were tested for

structural, surface and mechanical properties by X-ray
diffraction (XRD), SEM and tensile testing techniques,
respectively. The graph in Fig. 16a presents the X-ray
pattern of the film. It is clear from the patterns that most
intense reflection occurs at 2h–30.98o, which is very close
to the value mentioned in the literature (Daben 1990) for
PVDF-PZT nanocomposite. The intensity of (110) reflection increases as the PZT concentration increases from 10
to 50 wt%. In addition, with the increase in size of PZT
particle, the pattern remains same. This indicates that
although the particle size of PZT is varied, the crystallite
size remains same.

In order to study the microstructure and the dispersion of
the ceramic powder within the polymer matrix, SEM was
performed. A uniform distribution of PZT particles in the
PVDF matrix is seen (see Fig. 16b) which has been
observed by other investigators (Mendes et al. 2009; Suresh et al. 2009). From Fig. 16c, it has been found that the
modulus increases with an increase in PZT content. At 50
wt% of PZT, modulus is found to be 1574 MPa. The
increase in modulus and degree of crystallinity (discussed
earlier) improves the piezoelectric properties (Mendes
et al. 2009). After synthesis, the PVDF-PZT composite
films were electroded using silver ink and were poled using
thermal and corona poling method by the application of
high direct current (DC) electric field (9 kV/mm) at an
elevated temperature. Piezoelectric coefficients have been
measured using a Piezometer PM300. The average value of
piezoelectric charge coefficient d33 obtained is 40 pC/N,
and the maximum value obtained is 100 pC/N, which is
much higher than the value obtained for the single-phase
PVDF, which has an average d33 of 22 pC/N.
The PVDF-PZT sensor is tested for static and dynamic
strain sensing properties. The voltage response of the film
bonded on a beam is measured by subjecting the beam to
free vibration and transient impact loading. The sensor
bonded on a cantilever beam at its root is connected to the
oscilloscope (see Fig. 17). First, the sensitivity of the
bonded PVDF-PZT sensor to the dynamic strains induced
from the free vibration of the beam is studied.
The cantilever beam specimen used is aluminum having
length L = 0.33 m, width = 0.03 m and thickness
h = 0.0015 m. A free vibration is induced in the beam by
giving initial displacement and leaving it to vibrate on its
own. The response of the PVDF-PZT sensor is recorded
using oscilloscope with a sampling rate of 1 kHz. The
voltage response for free vibration is shown in Fig. 18a.
The frequency response is obtained by taking fast Fourier
transform (FFT) of the voltage response as shown in
Fig. 18b. Number of sampling points used in FFT is

where E is Young’s modulus, I = wh3/12 is the area
moment of inertia, q is the density and A is the crosssectional area. For aluminum material with E = 60 9 109
and q = 2700, the first two natural frequencies estimated
from elementary beam theory are F1 = 10.48 and
F2 = 65.73 Hz. The natural frequencies from the graph
(Fig. 18b) are F1 = 9.7 and F2 = 62.2 Hz. The peaks are
in good agreement with respect to the natural frequencies
obtained from the elementary beam model. Thus, the
developed PVDF-PZT nanocomposite film sensors have

(a)

the ability to capture multiple modes of vibrations
accurately.
Response of the PVDF-PZT sensor to impact loading is
obtained by dropping a steel ball on the tip of the cantilever
beam from a known height. A ball diameter of
d = 0.0095 m is dropped from a height of hI = 0.4 m at
the tip of the cantilever beam. The steel ball hits the beam
tip and falls off with negligible rebound of 1–2 mm converting entire impact energy into mechanical vibration.
Magnitude of impact in terms of energy can be estimated as
EI = mgh = 0.0137 N-m. The mass of ball is found to be
m = 3.5 g. Impact response of the sensor mounted at the
root of the cantilever is shown in Fig. 19a. The frequency
response (FFT of the sensor signals) is shown in Fig. 19b.
The sensor effectively captures the peaks in the frequency
response representing several resonant frequencies of the
beam. The natural frequencies from the graph (Fig. 19b)
are F1 = 9.7 Hz and F2 = 62.9 Hz, which again closely
matche the theoretical values. Thus, the developed PVDFPZT nanocomposite films have the ability to sense dynamic
strains resulting from impact. With good sensitivity, low
cost and corrosion resistance, these films are suitable for

acoustic emission monitoring and condition monitoring of
aircraft structures.
Epoxy/PZT coatings The high PZT content in an epoxy
matrix often leads to poor material homogeneity, which in
turn lowers the mechanical properties. Recently, a potentially attractive class of epoxy called liquid crystalline
thermosetting resins has been developed for the addition of
PZT (van den Ende et al. 2007). The piezoelectric charge
constants (d33) as a function of the PZT loading fraction are
depicted in Fig. 20a. The piezoelectric constant increased
with the increase in PZT loading. The novel epoxy/PZT
nanocomposites produced possess a high piezoelectric
charge constant d33. Recently, Rathod et al. (2014) have
used embedded epoxy/PZT sensors with 80 wt% PZT for
acoustic emission sensing applications for composite laminates. The acoustic emission sensed due to fiber breakage
during the tensile testing is shown in Fig. 20b. Thus, the
epoxy/PZT sensors qualify as the material for impact,
vibration and acoustic emission sensing in aircraft

structures. These nanocomposites show the potential to
replace existing piezoelectric materials for automobile and
aircraft applications especially operating in harsh
environments.
Polymer/ZnO films Apart from PZT nanoparticles, ZnO
particles also exhibit inherent piezoelectricity (Wang and
Song 2006; Zhu et al. 2008). (Loh and Chang 2011)
developed ZnO-embedded piezopolymer thin films for
dynamic strain sensing. Piezopolymer films were prepared
by dispersing 1 wt% ZnO nanoparticles (20 nm) in PSS
solution via 180 min of bath sonication (135 W, 42 kHz)
followed by 30 min of high-energy probe sonication
(4.76 mm tip, 150 W, 22 kHz). The resulting mixture was
mixed in an equal amount of PVA solution followed by
evaporation of solvent at 25 °C for 72 h. The resulting
PSS-PVA/ZnO nanocomposite was peeled off from the
substrate whose ZnO weight fraction WF can be calculated
from the relation

where W ZnO , W PSS and W PVA are the mass of ZnO, PSS
and PVA, respectively. The SEM image of a nanocomposite with WF = 50 is shown in Fig. 21a. The random
dispersion of ZnO nanoparticles indicated adequate dispersion in the polymeric matrix. The sizes of agglomerates
varied from 20 to 38 nm, which are lesser than twice the
size of nanoparticles. Thus, agglomeration was found to be
negligible.
The nanocomposite film was poled with electrodes
mounted on opposite edges of the film under moderate
electric field. The poled film was mounted on a cantilever
beam near the fixed end. The cantilever was subjected to
free vibration, and the voltage response of nanocomposite
film was measured. The output voltage VO was normalized
to take into account for the films of different sizes as

enhances the piezoelectricity in piezoelectric polymers
(Dodds et al. 2011). Realizing this, Meyers et al. (Meyers
et al. 2013) have further demonstrated the use of ZnObased nanocomposites as transducer for Lamb wave-based
SHM in pipe structure. Thus, ZnO-based nanocomposites
hold promising future in development of cost-effective
SHM systems for aircraft structures.

Ultrasonic mixing was avoided since CNTs suffer damage
by tip sonification and cavitation. The mix was cast in a

Piezoresistive polymer matrix nanocomposites
Piezoresistive sensors work on the principle of change in
resistance caused by the application of external stimuli.
Conventional strain gauges have a gauge factor of *2,
which is very low to detect the above-mentioned dynamic
strain in aircrafts. These sensors and piezoelectric transducers prove costly to monitor large aircraft structures. The
cost-effective piezoresistive nanocomposite sensors serve
as an alternative to such conventional sensors (Rathod et al.
2014; Sundararaman et al. 2015). Piezoresistive
nanocomposites contain conductive nanofillers like CNT
and CB that imparts conductivity.
PMMA/CNT Extremely small size of CNTs has enabled
Kang et al. (Kang et al. 2006) to develop artificial neuron
made up of long CNT fiber-based PMNC. SWNTs were
mixed in a solvent containing PMMA as a polymer-binding

ð11Þ

where DR is the normalized change of resistance
DR = (RS-RI)/RI with RS being the final resistance after
straining and RI being the initial resistance. With a percolation threshold of 0.1%, the variation of gauge factor is
shown in Fig. 22a, where the gauge factor decreases as the
CNT loading increases. The optimized content of SWNT
was found to be 3 wt%. The MWCNT-based nanocomposite neuron possesses SHM capability which can be seen
from the response observed (see Fig. 22b) when it is cut
half way along its width. Thus, nanocomposite neurons can
monitor very large areas of an aircraft for damages. Its easy
fabrication, simple instrumentation and low cost make it an
excellent choice as a sensor for SHM systems for large
aircrafts.
Epoxy/carbon black and Epoxy/CNT Embedded conventional sensors or transducers on the structure can act as a
defect and create interference in the normal operation of
the structure. For example, transducers (like PZT wafers)
mounted on the surface of the skin of a wing may disturb
the aerodynamic flow and reduce the efficiency of the
wing. To address this problem, smart paints have been
developed which are capable of sensing the dynamic strain
apart from providing the protective and decorative functions of the paint. Smart composite paints developed by
piezoelectric powder and epoxy resin require electroding
and poling, which is complex and expensive (Egusa and
Iwasawa 1998). Realizing the ability to measure the static
and quasi-static pressure (Knite et al. 2004; Lu et al. 2006),
Aldraihem et al. (Aldraihem et al. 2009) demonstrated the
ability to measure dynamic pressure using epoxy/carbonblack nanocomposite sensor.

The nanocomposite paint sensors were prepared by

where the first part is due to static pressure and the second
part is due to mechanical vibration. After modeling of the
nanocomposite paints, Aldraihem et al. (2009) superposed
its results that matched well with the experiments as shown
in Fig. 24. With the availability of mathematical model and
nanocomposite paint sensor, the sensor sensitivity can be
studied for tuning capabilities to suit for parameters like
frequency, strain level and environment conditions
encountered by aerospace structures. The epoxy/CB
nanocomposite paint can act as a continuously distributed
sensor over large aircraft structures, fairing of launch
vehicles and flexible space structures for vibration, noise
and health monitoring applications. Apart from these carbon black-based pressure sensors, strain sensors have also
been reported. The addition of combination of carbon black
and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) in epoxy
matrix results in a strain sensor with additional capabilities.
Recently, Anand and Roy Mahapatra (2009a, b) have
developed such highly sensitive strain sensor with the
addition of 33% carbon black and *0.57% MWNTs that
possess quasi-static and dynamic strain sensing capability,
which is common parameter of interest to be monitored in

down the cost of the sensor. They studied the variation of
MWNT concentration on the performance of the strain
sensor and brought out a technique to actively tune the
gauge factor by varying the bias voltage of the sensing
circuit (a voltage divider).
Shape memory deployable structures
Shape memory polymers recover strain of over 50–400%
upon the application of heat. This ability has attracted the
application of shape memory polymers in deployable
aerospace structures. Recoverable strain in shape memory
polymers is several orders higher than shape memory
alloys. However, recovery stress is limited due to their
lower stiffness. Recoverable stress improves by the addition of reinforcements (Gall et al. 2002). Gall et al. (2004)
demonstrated the storage and release of internal stress in
active PMNC with SiC nanoreinforcements. About 20 wt%
SiC nanoparticles (700 nm diameter) were added to an
epoxy polymer resin. A well-dispersed nanoparticle in
polymer matrix was confirmed by SEM as shown in
Fig. 25a (Gall et al. 2002). The stress–strain response of
the epoxy/SiC nanocomposite at deformation temperature
Td = 25 °C is shown in Fig. 25b. Elastic response
exhibiting up to 50% strain followed the yielding and
inelastic flow. The unloading resulted in an elastic recovery
initially, followed by a nonlinear and spontaneous strain
recovery. A residual inelastic strain of 35% was fully
recovered by heating at TR = 120 °C.
To determine the residual stress, a duplicate sample
was held in the deformed state (2) under a fixed strain
subjected to a similar heating profile observed during a

full strain recovery. A recovery stress of 31 MPa was
observed which is much higher than pure shape memory
polymer resin. Other nanocomposites with nanofillers like
CNT, carbon nanofiber, clay, CB and other organic particles also possess similar capabilities of improving the
mechanical strength and shape recovery stress (Meng and
Hu 2009). Clay imparts similar properties as SiC
nanoparticles. CNT and CB nanofillers impart electrical
and thermal conductive capabilities required by aerospace
applications. The shape recovery property along with the
thermal and conductive properties proposes the epoxy/SiC
nanocomposites for aerospace deployable structure
applications.

Conductive electromagnetic shielding structures
Modern airliners like Boeing 787 and Airbus 380 face
challenges to satisfy mechanical and electromagnetic
requirements simultaneously. Electromagnetic (EM)
shielding is the ability to reflect and absorb the electromagnetic radiation to act as a shield against the penetration
of radiation through it (Chung 2001). Apart from providing
EM protection from lightning strike, conductive composites offer intentional interference with radar-absorbing
materials, equipment-level shielding, protection from highintensity radiated fields and mitigation of human exposure.
Carbon fiber composites have been extensively studied for
such applications since their properties can be tailored
(Neo and Varadan 2004). Epoxy-based nanocomposites
have been well proven for their EMI shielding capabilities.
Compared to nanocomposites with silver, iron oxide
(Fe3O4) and iron (Fe) nanoparticles, epoxy/CNT
nanocomposites have been reported to have better EMI
shielding properties (Gairola et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2014).
Epoxy/CNT nanocomposites showed 99.9% energy
absorption capability in the X-band (8–12.4 GHz). A SEM
of epoxy/CNT nanocomposite (see Fig. 26) showed the
electrical and thermal paths in the form of CNT networks
(Micheli et al. 2011a). Incorporation of CNT effects the
mechanical properties as shown in Table 1, in Sect. 2.1.2.
The shielding effectiveness SE is defined by the ratio of
signal received with the sample and without sample given
by
 2

S
SEðdBÞ ¼ 10Log 2OPEN ;
ð14Þ
SMATER
where SOPEN is the scattering parameter (that is, the ratio of
signal transmitted to signal received by the antenna) in the
presence of shielding material and SMATER is the scattering
parameter in the absence of shielding material.
The improvement in the shielding effectiveness measured by a vector network analyzer is shown in Fig. 27
(Micheli et al. 2011a). The measurements were done with
the sample normal to the direction of electromagnetic wave
propagation. The measured SE matched well with the SE
predicted by a mathematical model following a winning
particle optimization algorithm (Micheli et al. 2011b). The
high shielding effectiveness property of 10 wt% CNT
nanocomposite was comparable to that of an aluminum
enclosure. Addition of multiple layers of shielding materials can give rise to additional reflections, which increases
the SE. Epoxy/CNT nanocomposites also showed flame
retardancy due to the formation of a jammed network
structure in polymeric matrix (Im et al. 2010). Moreover,

layer of 6 wt% MWCNTs and 10 wt% MWCNTs (reproduced from

multifunctional properties like high thermal and electrical
conductivities and mechanical properties make them suitable for aerospace application where strength, lightning
strike protection and EMI shielding are required (Im et al.
2010). EM and radar-absorbing capabilities can be realized
using biphase and triphase carbon fiber-reinforced
nanocomposites (De Rosa et al. 2008). Thus, these
nanocomposites can be installed on aircrafts as advanced
EM shields for stealth applications or EMI suppression.

Ceramic matrix nanocomposites
Ceramics are brittle materials susceptible to fracture. Most
aerospace components are subjected to vibration and fatigue for which ceramics are not suitable. However,
ceramics are hard, inert and stable at higher temperature
levels. Aircraft components subjected to elevated temperature levels and corrosive environment require such properties. Significant effort has been put to impart toughness to
the ceramic materials. To prevent ceramics from fracture,
ductile phase is added which improves strength and fracture toughness. Properties of the nanocomposite relate
primarily to the ratio of surface area/volume and relation of
different phases of matrix and reinforcements. Various
CMNCs for aerospace applications with their properties
and the related morphology at nanoscale are presented
next.
Alumina/MWNT for EM shielding applications
Alumina is typically used in structural applications but is
an electrical insulator for which it cannot be used in aircrafts. CNTs are seen to impart toughness to the ceramic
matrix with improved properties compared to the conventional carbon and SiC fibers, which just imparts toughness.
MWNTs show multichannel, quasi-ballistic conducting
behavior due to the participation of multiple walls in the
electrical transport (Li et al. 2005). Their large diameter
results in small band gap for semiconductor activity. High
current density and conductivity (107 A/cm and
1.85 9 103 S/cm, respectively) of MWNTs render them
electrically conductive always (Ando et al. 1999). Loading
of MWNTs in alumina results in improved structural
integrity and electrical conductivity (Curtin and Sheldon
2004). Thus, it is worth to present the preparation method
and alternating current (AC) and DC conductivity studies
of alumina/MWNT nanocomposites developed by Ahmad
and Pan (2009). MWNTs were mixed ultrasonically with
alumina in ethanol followed by ball milling for 24 h. The
mixture was dried and transferred in cylindrical graphite
mold to be plasma sintered at 1400 °C in vacuum under a
pressure of 50 MPa.
Figure 28 shows a SEM of MWNT/alumina nanocomposite (fractured surface) with 3 wt% MWNT. A welldispersed intertwining network formed by MWNTs at the
grain boundaries can be seen. Conduction via tube–tube
within the bundle and interlinked network of ropes results
in the overall conduction in such nanocomposite. A standard four-point probe method gave the DC conductivity as
shown in Fig. 29a. Insulator conductor transition was
exhibited between 0.4 and 0.5 wt% of MWNTs. Eight
order increase in conductivity was observed at 0.5%

where rdc and rc are the DC conductivities of the
nanocomposite and the filler, respectively. PMWNT and Pc
are the weight fraction and percolation threshold,
respectively.
The fit in Fig. 29a has the t = 1.82 (represents the
dimensionality of the system) and Pc = 0.45 wt%. A
smaller amount of t is contributed by the hopping between
weakly connected parts of the network (Reghu et al. 1994).
For t \ 2, thermally induced hopping transport dominates
the conduction. Increase in wt% of MWNTs enhances the
conductive path by increasing the inter-nanotube connections. Tunneling resistance is caused by inter-nanotube
connections (Li et al. 2007). The conductivity of the
nanocomposites is also seen to increase with temperature.
The carrier mobility and thermally generated carrier
mobility increase with temperature causing semiconductorlike effect. Fluctuation-induced tunneling model is used to
describe this effect as a change of barrier height by fluctuation of thermal voltage causing the tunneling of the
electrons (Ping 1980). The conductivity is given by (Sheng
et al. 1978)

Alumina/MWNT for SHM applications

as a function of MWNT contents. Inset shows DC conductivity with
(PMWNT–Pc). b Frequency-dependent conductivity of the MWNT/
alumina nanocomposites (Reproduced from (Ahmad and Pan 2009),
with the permission from Elsevier)

AC conductivity studies were done using an impedance
analyzer at frequency ranging from 5 to 15 MHz at room
temperature. The conductivity was initially constant and
increased at higher frequencies for samples just above the
percolation threshold (0.4 wt%) (see Fig. 29b). For higher
MWCNT percentage, the conductivity becomes frequency
independent. Below percolation threshold, the conductivity
increases linearly with the slope of curve closer to unity
indicating highly resistive material. The curve obeys the
expression of dielectric conductivity r = 2Gfee0, where ei
is the imaginary part of permittivity and e0 is the vacuum
permittivity. In addition to the electrical properties, they
possess excellent resistance to chemical, corrosion,
extreme radiation and ultraviolet exposure generally
encountered by aerospace structures. With these properties,
MWNT alumina nanocomposites are suitable as electrostatic dissipation materials for aerospace structures.

123

Apart from applications like energy, transportation,
defense, sporting goods and civil infrastructure, CMNCs
are being researched for automotive and aerospace applications (De Volder et al. 2013). Automotive and aerospace
applications demand SHM capabilities for safety of life and
infrastructure, as explained in Sect. 2.4. Inam et al. (2014)
presented the SHM capability in ceramic/carbon
nanocomposite. SWNTs were dispersed in DMF by ultrasonication for 30 min followed by hand mixing of alumina
nanopowder (particle size \50 nm). Ball milling of the
mixture was done for 7 h followed by drying in rotary
dryer for 12 h (60 °C) and in vacuum over for 48 h
(100 °C). The mixture was ground and sieved at 250 mesh
followed by drying in vacuum oven for 48 h (100 °C).
Nanocomposites were prepared by spark plasma sintering
(Jackson et al. 2010) from which 18 9 3 9 3 mm bars
were prepared for various tests.
Images in Fig. 30 show the fractured microstructure of
alumina/CNT nanocomposite obtained from SEM. Homogeneously dispersed CNTs in various isolated location and
a CNT mesh in central fractured location indicated uniform
dispersion obtained by milling and drying process. Vickers
indentations were performed with 500 g load and 10 s of
indentation time. Five equally spaced indents were produced with parallel measurement of bulk electrical conductivity at room temperature using a four-point method. A
drastic change in electrical conductivity was seen in alumina/CNT nanocomposite with number of indents. CNT
and graphene-based nanocomposites showed higher sensitivity toward indentation damage. Also superposed are the
results obtained from alumina/CB and alumina/graphene
nanoplatelets. The indentation causes microcracks
attributing to the fracture of fibers that result in reduced
conductivity. Higher fracture toughness was also seen in
these nanocomposites. Thus, with improved fracture
toughness and safety provided by SHM capability, alumina/CNT nanocomposites can be used as structural
components of aircraft, spacecraft and reentry vehicle
operating at higher temperature.
Aerospace tribology
Aerospace systems involve costly inspection and maintenance procedures due to friction and wear in various
movable devices. The parts that require periodic maintenance are the bearing surfaces of gears, pumps, reaction
wheels, latches, sensor orientation mechanisms, actuators,
antenna drives, solar arrays and gyroscopes (Voevodin
et al. 1999). The life of bearing surfaces is affected by the
loading, operating conditions and environmental conditions. Loading results in typical contact stress of 107–1010

Appl Nanosci (2017) 7:519–548

Pa with sliding velocity varying from 0 to 20 m/s. This
type of loading is typically a result of vibrations that causes
wear and fatigue of the bearing surfaces. Extreme operating
conditions at high and low altitude subject the tribological
surfaces to variation of humidity and temperature (-40 to
?300 °C for aircrafts and -100 to ?100 °C for space
objects). The environment cycling and dust experienced by
aircrafts also add to the problems of wear in bearing surfaces. High altitude aircrafts like SR-71 reconnaissance
plane ‘Blackbird’ and spacecraft are subjected to atomic
oxygen and electrostatically attracted dust causing abrasive
wear (Graham 1997). Forthcoming space applications such
as bearings for moment control devices and solar array
joints require 109–1010 and 106–108 cycles, respectively,
for a span of 15–30 years. Conventionally, solid lubricants
like polymers, soft metals, PTFE and dichalcogenides have
been used. Liquid lubricants like mineral oils and synthetic
oils are used in sealed assemblies. Such lubrication and
wear reduction methods cannot withstand the endurance
requirements of aerospace like abrasion and oxidation
resistance.

541

To meet the aerospace requirements, transition-metal
dichalcogenides like MoS2, WS2, niobium diselenide
(NbSe2) are mixed with organic and inorganic binders and
the resulting mixture is deposited by spray or vacuum
deposition process (Bhushan and Gupta 1991). The vacuum deposition technique allows the control of morphology, structure, chemistry and thickness of the coatings.
Vacuum deposition also allows hard and lubricious phases
in nanocomposite coatings. With these capabilities,
advanced hard coatings that meet the aerospace endurance
requirements can be prepared to reduce wear and friction
(Miyoshi et al. 1997). Two-phase titanium carbide/DLC
(TiC/DLC) and WC/DLC nanocomposites are not suitable in high-vacuum environment (Voevodin et al.
1996a, 1996b) due to increase in friction from the
graphitization of DLC. Space lubricants like MoS2 or WS2
embedded in carbide/DLC/WC dichalcogenide composite
last more than million cycles in space environment with
humid/dry cycling (Voevodin et al. 1998). An adaptive
WC/DLC/WS2 coating developed by Voevodin et al.
(1999) imparts wear resistance and mechanical strength
due to the presence of hard and crystalline WC. Amorphous DLC provides low wear and friction, whereas WS2
phase provides lubrication in vacuum meeting the aerospace requirements.
Voevodin et al. (1996a, 1996b) produced WC/DLC/WS2
coatings by magnetron assisted pulsed laser deposition or
by laser ablation. Approximately 0.5-lm thick coatings
were obtained, which were polished to 0.02 lm Ra. At a
vacuum of 10–6 Pa, the magnetron was operated with WS2
target 8 W-cm-2 with 0.2 Pa argon such that the plasma
was directed at 45° to the surface. A controlled laser beam
ablates the graphite surface at 45° angle such that the
composition was controlled by varying the WS2 sector
area. The microstructure and the diffraction pattern
demonstrate hexagonal WS2 crystal structure (see Fig. 31).
One type of basal planes is perpendicular to the crystal axis
(c-axis) with the spacing of 0.6 nm between the planes.
Another set of basal planes have the spacing of 3 nm with
the c-axis parallel to them. Grains of 5–10 nm randomly
orient in the surrounding with dark and gray areas representing b-WC and DLC. WC/DLC/WS2 coatings consist of
nearly amorphous or extremely nanocrystalline phases with
10 nm dimension.
A nanoindenter microprobe loaded in the range of 1 mN
was used to determine hardness and Young’s moduli.
Maximum penetration and load displacement curves were
used to determine hardness and moduli, respectively. The
hardness of the nanocomposite as a function of sulfur
content is shown in Fig. 32. The coating hardness
decreased from 15 to 7 GPa at 15–20% sulfur. At this
composition, the elastic modulus also decreased from 230
to 250 GPa to 100–130 GPa. The drop in properties is the

results of the segregation of soft WS2 in the material. Due
to the multiphase material composition, the entire range of
hardness lies in between the hardness of WC having 24–28
GPa and WS2 having 3 GPa (Bhushan and Gupta 1991).
However, this slight reduction in hardness can result in
significant low wear rates and increased endurance.
A ball on disk tribometer was used to measure the
friction of the nanocomposite coatings. Hundred gm of
load was applied on a stainless steel ball with sliding speed
of 10 m/min. The data were obtained on steady wear
conditions over 50,000 sliding cycles. Similarities were
seen in the variation of friction coefficient obtained in
vacuum and nitrogen environments. A sharp reduction of
friction coefficient resulted with 15–20% sulfur due to the
formation of thick transfer films. Low friction resulted
from WS2 due to week van der Waals forces between
layers of S–W–S planes facilitating inter- and intra-crystalline slip (Prasad and Zabinski 1997). Reorientation and

analysis. Friction coefficient obtained from the tests in
vacuum was found to be highest when compared to friction
coefficients in moist air and nitrogen. A lower friction
coefficient of 0.1 was observed at a lower sulfur content.
This was due to the formation of amorphous carbon in the
wear tracks. With 15–20% sulfur, WS3 and tungsten trioxide (WO3) phases were detected by Raman analysis.
Oxidation of ball material also leads to the occurrence of
Fe2O3 and chrome oxide. This transfer of ball material
leads to an increase in coefficient of friction. Coatings with
more than 20% sulfur show lower coefficient of friction.
The friction coefficient study indicates the need of 20%
sulfur coating.
Endurance tests were carried out in space conditions
(vacuum) of long duration with 2,000,000 cycles. A profilometer and an optical microscope were used to track the
area and diameter of the wear track used in the estimation
of normalized wear volume (mm3/N-m). Figure 33 shows
the variation of wear rate with sulfur content after 10,000
sliding cycles in different environments. The wear rate
decreases considerably at 20% sulfur content. A similar
behavior was seen in the variation of friction coefficient.
Reverse dependence was seen in moist air. With 20–30%
sulfur, the wear rate was lowest in vacuum. This lowest
wear rate is due to the formation of WO3. The coatings
with 22% sulfur further endured two million sliding cycles
with friction coefficient of 0.03–0.06. Slight reduction in
friction with test duration was seen due to the ongoing
process of reorientation and accumulation of WS2 phase.
This type of higher initial wear followed by long period of
low wear is typical in solid lubricants (Singer et al. 1996).
Additional requirement posed by aerospace bearing
applications is the stability of the performance in environment with varying humidity, for which the test environment was varied between dry nitrogen \0.05% RH and
moist air with 50% RH for every 5000 sliding cycles. The
coatings with 15% sulfur showed friction coefficient of

Appl Nanosci (2017) 7:519–548

Fig. 33 Variation of wear rates as a function of sulfur content for
moist air (filled square), dry nitrogen (circle) and high vacuum (filled
circle) (reproduced from (Voevodin et al. 1999), with the permission
from Elsevier)

0.02–0.05 and 0.1–0.2 at low and high humidity, respectively. WS2 and DLC provided the lubrication in low and
high humid conditions, respectively. The coatings have the
capability to adapt to the humidity conditions by destroying
the WS2 planes by oxidation, replacing them with graphite
planes formed from DLC through friction-induced transformation. The next dry cycle causes desorption of water
molecules resulting in the wear of graphite sheets leading
to the exposure of WS2 grains. The low wear, low friction
and adaptability to changing environment of WC/DLC/
WS2 coatings fulfill the criteria for space applications,
which is wear rate\10–6 mm3/N-m and friction coefficient
\0.1 (Voevodin et al. 1999). Thus, the adaptive WC/DLC/
WS2 coatings are excellent tribological materials for selflubricated wear-resistant coatings for aerospace and space
applications that demand excellent endurance and low wear
rates in different environments.

Perspectives and challenges
Upcoming potentials of nanocomposites can be easily
guessed by the massive investments of researchers and
industrialists worldwide in research and development. For
instance, General Motors have used nanoclay and talc for
structural applications. GE and Cabot in USA are using
nanocomposites in the form of nanosmart switches, conductive polymers and sensors. Such commercialization will
ease the availability and bring down the cost of
nanocomposites. Advancement of processing methods
together with the molecular level control of nanomaterials
distribution and interaction with the matrix material is seen
to optimize the properties and performance of nanocomposites. Thus, the nanocomposites have a good chance in
the application of advanced aerospace systems. Advances

543

in robust manufacturing technology for nanocomposites
will enable their migration in applications like electronics,
thin films, ultralight aerostructures and shape memory
polymers for space-deployable spacecrafts. Electrochromic
polymers are being developed for thermo-optical uses,
whereas electroactive polymers have the potentials to be
used in the design of photoactive structures suitable for
space missions. Recent advancements in polymer
nanocomposites and the current research trend are creating
new opportunities to develop next-generation aircraft and
space structures (Youssef 2013). In case of PMNC, fire
retardancy and weatherability is seen to gain much
importance. In case of CMNC coatings, engine components, temperature sensors and high temperature structures
can receive much importance. The PMNCs are far ahead in
development when compared to CMNC and MMNCs. This
is due to their development being driven by funding and
their technology readiness or maturity level. The new
manufacturing techniques for chirally sorted CNTs
(Ganzhorn et al. 2011) and long CNTs ranging to half
meter (Zhang et al. 2013) have the potential to open new
areas of research and development for sensing and structural applications for aerospace industry.
The present paper focusses on the available solutions
that suit aerospace/space applications. However for these
solutions to be incorporated practically in various different
aerospace structures, aerospace certification requirements
may pose additional studies to be done related to manufacturability, reliability, uniformity and repeatability.
Affordability and availability are other aspects which
aerospace industry will consider to curb cost and save time.
Nanocomposites face several challenges in their processing
and characterization. For instance, processing of nanofibers
is difficult which if solved will yield ultralightweight
components as compared to their microfiber counterparts.
Development of nanocomposites involves interdisciplinary
research involving chemistry, physics, materials science
and engineering to relate various properties with the
nanostructure. Improvement of mechanical properties by
surface modification of nanofiber and determination of
properties by modeling and simulation can aid in the
development of nanocomposites. Dispersion, alignment,
volume fraction and ease of fabrication along with their
cost factor are the critical parameters to decide the potential of nanocomposites (Thostenson et al. 2005). A processing nanostructure property map developed by Ashby
(1992) provides the method to take into account of most of
these critical factors.
Release of nanoparticles in environment is hazardous
since they can interact with cells by their reactivity,
nanosized structure and surface area. This has received
huge attention in recent times to study the human and
environmental exposure to nanomaterials via waste

123

544

materials and other pathways (Aschberger et al. 2011;
Dreher 2004). A stringent requirement for clean environment demands the use of fillers of natural origin to obtain
recyclable and biodegradable nanocomposites. Natural fillers are minerals, vegetal materials, reinforcements based
on common elements, layered double hydroxides and layered hydroxide salts (Camargo et al. 2009). Similarly,
environment-friendly polymer matrix can be derived from
plasticized polyhydroxylalkanoates, saccharides, polylactide and poly (e-caprolactone). The low cost of these fillers
and matrix will enable their use in variety of aerospace
applications.

Concluding remarks
Nanocomposite is an evolving area of interdisciplinary
research motivated by nanotechnology. The capability to
tailor materials at nanoscale has opened up the possibilities
of developing next-generation multifunctional materials
suitable to meet the requirements posed by the aerospace
industry. Structural failure, lightning strike, icing and
erosion pose several requirements on aerospace systems.
The aerospace requirements like mechanical, chemical,
thermal and electrical properties are achieved by polymer
and CMNC with the nanofillers like nanoclay, alumina,
carbon nanotubes, nanocarbon, TiO2, SiC, PZT.
Nanoclays are affordable nanofillers that impart high
strength, low permeability and excellent flame-retardant
properties suitable for aerospace structures. MMT
nanocomposites and DOPO-based phosphorus tetraglycidyl
nanocomposites also satisfy the structural requirements of
aerospace. CNTs and CB impart the electrical and thermal
conductivity to the nanocomposites structures sufficient to
provide lightning strike resistance to aircrafts. Carbon
black-based piezoresistive nanocomposite strain gauges
show a high gauge factor of 26 that is suitable for vibration-based condition monitoring and SHM in large aircraft
structures. CNT-based conductive nanocomposites have
also demonstrated the EM shielding and radar-absorbing
capabilities for aircrafts. Polyurethane nanocomposite
coatings containing carbon nanotubes have lightning
resistance, deicing capabilities and EM shielding capabilities as required for commercial and military aircrafts.
Apart from structural and coating applications, nanocomposites are developed as lightweight bearings for aerospace
and space applications. These are PMNCs like PTFE/TiO2
and CMNC like WC/DLC/WS2 coatings. Aerospace
industry requires repeatable properties of structures for
their certifications. This is possible if the nanoparticle
content is same throughout and the nanoparticles have
uniform size, shape and chirality. In addition, uniform and
consistent supply of nanoparticles is required to avoid

123

recertification of parts with new nanoparticles, which is
very expensive.
Future research is being focused on the development of
processing techniques to enhance dispersion of fillers,
reduce the agglomeration and increase the interface properties between the nanofiller and the matrix. To solve these
problems, the use of simulation tools to study the
enhancement of properties will be beneficial. In addition,
the development of low-cost biodegradable nanocomposites will significantly benefit life and environment.
